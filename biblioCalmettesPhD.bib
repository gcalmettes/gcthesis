	Abstract = {This chapter describes the basic principles of Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) which is a quantitative methodology to evaluate the importance and relative contribution of individual metabolic steps in the overall functioning of a particular system. The control on the flux through a metabolic pathway or subsystem can be quantified by the control coefficients of the individual enzymes or components which reflects the extent to which the component is rate-limiting. The perturbation of an individual step is measured by its elasticity coefficient. The effect of perturbation of a single step on the entire pathway or subsystem is, in turn, measured by the response coefficient. Differential control analysis can be used to compare flux through a single metabolic pathway in a pathogen with the same pathway in its host to identify uniquely vulnerable steps with the greatest potential for specifically inhibiting flux through the pathogen metabolic pathway. The utility of this methodology is illustrated with the glycolysis in Trypanosomes and with oncogenic signaling.},

	Abstract = {The effects of temperature on the control of respiration rate, phosphorylation rate, proton leakage rate, the protonmotive force and the effective ATP/O ratio were determined in isolated rat liver mitochondria over a range of respiratory conditions by applying top-down elasticity and control analyses. Simultaneous measurements of membrane potential, oxidation and phosphorylation rates were performed under various ATP turnover rates, ranging from state 4 to state 3. Although the activities of the three subsystems decreased with temperature (over 30-fold between 37 and 4 degrees C), the effective ATP/O ratio exhibited a maximum at 25 degrees C, far below the physiological value. Top-down elasticity analysis revealed that maximal membrane potential was maintained over the range of temperature studied, and that the proton leakage rate was considerably reduced at 4 degrees C. These results definitely rule out a possible uncoupling of mitochondria at low temperature. At 4 degrees C, the decrease in ATP/O ratio is explained by the relative decrease in phosphorylation processes revealed by the decrease in depolarization after ADP addition [Diolez and Moreau (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 806, 56-63]. The change in depolarization between 37 and 25 degrees C was too small to explain the decrease in ATP/O ratio. This result is best explained by the changes in the elasticity of proton leakage to membrane potential between 37 and 25 degrees C, leading to a higher leak rate at 37 degrees C for the same value of membrane potential. Top-down control analysis showed that despite the important changes in activities of the three subsystems between 37 and 25 degrees C, the patterns of the control distribution are very similar. However, a different pattern was obtained at 4 degrees C under all phosphorylating conditions. Surprisingly, control by the proton leakage subsystem was almost unchanged, although both control patterns by substrate oxidation and phosphorylation subsystems were affected at 4 degrees C. In comparison with results for 25 and 37 degrees C, at 4 degrees C there was evidence for increased control by the phosphorylation subsystem over both fluxes of oxidation and phosphorylation as well as on the ATP/O ratio when the system is close to state 3. However, the pattern of control coefficients as a function of mitochondrial activity also showed enhanced control exerted by the substrate oxidation subsystem under all intermediate conditions. These results suggest that passive membrane permeability to protons is not involved in the effect of temperature on the control of oxidative phosphorylation.},

	Abstract = {AIMS: beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR)-mediated relaxation was characterized in pulmonary arteries from normoxic and hypoxic (as model of pulmonary hypertension) mice. The endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) pathway was especially investigated because of its potential vasculoprotective effects. METHODS: Pulmonary arteries from control or hypoxic (0.5 atm for 21 days) wild-type or eNOS-/- mice were used for pharmacological characterization of beta-AR-mediated relaxation in myograph, and for immunohistochemistry using anti-beta-AR antibodies. RESULTS: In pulmonary arteries from normoxic mice, isoproterenol (beta-AR agonist) and procaterol (selective beta2-AR agonist) elicited relaxation, while cyanopindolol and CL316243 (beta3-AR agonists) were ineffective. The effect of isoproterenol was antagonized by CGP20712A and ICI118551 (beta1- or beta2-AR antagonists, respectively) and also partially inhibited by N omega-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, a NOS inhibitor), endothelium denudation, or eNOS gene deletion. Relaxation to procaterol was abolished by L-NAME or endothelium removal. In eNOS-/- mice, procaterol-induced relaxation was decreased but was insensitive to L-NAME, this residual effect involving other endothelium-dependent relaxant factors as compensatory mechanisms. Immunostaining for beta2-AR was observed in the endothelial layer, but not the medial layer of pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary arteries from hypoxic mice exhibited decreased endothelial NO-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. However, in these arteries, relaxation to procaterol was either unaffected (extralobar segments) or even increased (intralobar segments) and was still abolished by L-NAME or endothelium removal. CONCLUSION: beta1- and beta2-AR, but not beta3-AR, mediate relaxation of mice pulmonary arteries. The beta2-AR component is dependent on eNOS activity and is preserved following chronic hypoxia. These data highlight the role of the beta2-AR as a pharmacological target to induce/restore endothelial NO-dependent protective effects in pulmonary circulation.},

@article{Delannoy:2010ys,
	Abstract = {AIMS: This study investigates the role of the cyclooxygenase (COX)/prostanoid pathway in chronic hypoxia-induced hyperreactivity of pulmonary arteries. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pulmonary arteries were removed from normoxic or hypoxic (0.5 atm for 21 days) mice and studied for protein expression/localization of COX-1, COX-2, and thromboxane A2 (TXA2)-synthase, release of TXA2, prostacyclin (PGI2) and the isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha), and vasomotor responses. COX-2 expression was increased in all layers of pulmonary arteries from hypoxic mice. In contrast, COX-1 expression was not significantly modified following chronic hypoxia, whereas TXA2-synthase was decreased. Chronic hypoxia differentially affected prostanoid release from pulmonary arteries: TXA2 secretion was not significantly modified; PGI2 secretion was decreased, whereas 8-iso-PGF2alpha secretion was increased. A selective COX-2 inhibitor decreased 8-iso-PGF2alpha release. Arachidonic acid elicited an endothelium- and COX-1-dependent relaxation in pulmonary arteries from normoxic mice. In contrast, arachidonic acid induced an endothelium-independent contraction in pulmonary arteries from hypoxic mice that was partially reduced by catalase, COX-1, COX-2, or TXA2-synthase inhibitors and was totally abolished by blockade of the thromboxane (TP) receptor. Hyperresponsiveness to phenylephrine (PE) of pulmonary arteries from hypoxic mice was also decreased by COX-2 inhibitors, TP receptor antagonists or catalase, but not by TXA2-synthase inhibitors. Finally, 8-iso-PGF2alpha induced a TP receptor-dependent contraction in pulmonary arteries and markedly potentiated the contractile response to PE. CONCLUSION: Chronic hypoxia up-regulates COX-2 expression, increases 8-iso-PGF2alpha release, and shifts arachidonic acid-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation to an endothelium-independent and TP receptor-dependent contraction in pulmonary arteries. COX-2-dependent production of 8-iso-PGF2alpha, by activating TP receptors, participates in hypoxia-induced hyperreactivity of pulmonary arteries.},

	Abstract = {Both theoretical and experimental results are presented for in vivo calibration of the dissociation constant K(Ca)(d)of the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Rhod(2)in the perfused mouse heart, using manganese quenching of fluorescence transients. An analytical model is derived, based on the biochemical equilibrium of manganese competition with calcium for Rhod(2)binding. Expressing the differential of the changes between systole and diastole in fluorescence transient (delta Delta F(sys-dia)). delta DeltaF(sys-dia)in a beating heart as a function of the perfusate manganese concentration [Mn(2+)](p)allows correlation of the measured differential transient changes delta Delta F(sys-dia)with the calcium dissociation constant K(Ca)(d)of Rhod(2)and the calcium concentration in the heart. Numerical modeling indicates that the K(Ca)(d)predominantly affects the asymptotic slope of the delta Delta F(sys-dia)versus [Mn(2+)](p)curve at certain manganese concentrations, which suggests that the K(Ca)(d)can be inversely calculated by partially fitting the delta Delta F(sys-dia)distribution as a function of the perfusate manganese concentration. The feasibility of this approach is confirmed by quenching of calcium transients by manganese infusion into isolated perfused beating mouse hearts. The resulting calculated dissociation constant K(Ca)(d)of Rhod(2)is 720nM. Using the same approach, we are able to also estimate intracellular calcium concentrations of 700nM at peak systole and 300nM in diastole. This is in good agreement with values obtained by calibration of fluorescence values with a calcium saturation tetanization procedure in the same perfused mouse heart model.},

@article{Du:2001kx,
	Abstract = {Both theoretical and experimental results are presented for the quantitative detection of calcium transients in the perfused mouse heart loaded with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Rhod-2. Analytical models are proposed to calculate both the reflected absorbance and fluorescence spectra detected from the mouse heart. These models allow correlation of the measured spectral intensities with the relative quantity of Rhod-2 in the heart and measurement of the changes in quantum yield of Rhod-2 upon binding calcium in the heart in which multiple scattering effects are predominant. Theoretical modeling and experimental results demonstrate that both reflected absorbance and fluorescence emission are attenuated linearly with Rhod-2 washout. According to this relation, a ratiometric method using fluorescence and absorbance is validated as a measure of the quantum yield of calcium-dependent fluorescence, enabling determination of the dynamics of cytosolic calcium in the perfused mouse heart. The feasibility of this approach is confirmed by experiments quantifying calcium transients in the perfused mouse heart stimulated at 8 Hz. The calculated cytosolic calcium concentrations are 368 +/- 68 nM and 654 +/- 164 nM in diastole and systole, respectively. Spectral distortions induced by tissue scattering and absorption and errors induced by the geometry of the detection optics in the calcium quantification are shown to be eliminated by using the ratio method. Methods to effectively minimize motion-induced artifacts and to monitor the oxygenation status of the whole perfused heart are also discussed.},

@article{MacGowan:2001uq,
	Abstract = {We have demonstrated a method of measuring intracellular calcium in the perfused mouse heart with the red fluorescent dye rhod-2. In Langendorff perfused isolated mouse hearts, rhod-2 is bolused through the perfusate, resulting in a 6.2+/-1.9-fold increase in fluorescence over background, and calcium transients with a transient amplitude to diastolic fluorescence ratio of 33+/-9\%. Quantification of the relative amount of rhod-2 in the heart was done by taking the ratio of absorbance at 524 nm (rhod-2 sensitive) to 589 nm (rhod-2 insensitive). Maximal calcium saturated fluorescence was measured during tetanization of the heart with calcium chloride (20 mM) and cyclopiazonic acid (10 microM). Electron microscopy was used to determine the subcellular localization of rhod-2, by fixing rhod-2 in the heart with a carbodiimide compound, and then using a double antibody technique to stain rhod-2. These images demonstrated prominent cytosolic rhod-2 localization. Fluorescence and confocal fluorescence microscopy were consistent with the electron microscopy data. Endothelial cell uptake of rhod-2 was shown with fluorescence microscopy, though functional studies with bradykinin infusion (3 microM), which increases endothelial cell calcium, had no effects on mean fluorescence (N=4, p=NS), suggesting that endothelial uptake was small relative to total fluorescence. Calculated values of intracellular calcium were 686+/-237 nM at peak systole, and 360+/-101 nM in diastole, and with high perfusate calcium (3.5 mM) were 1199+/-215 and 544+/-53 nM, respectively. Thus, this appears a valid method of measuring cytosolic calcium in the perfused mouse heart, which will help determine the mechanisms of altered contractility in genetically engineered mice.},

	Abstract = {To gain some insight into the mechanism of cell photostimulation by laser light, measurements were made of the rate of ADP/ATP exchange in mitochondria irradiated with the low power continuous wave Helium Neon laser (energy dose 5 Joules/cm2). To do this a method has been developed to continuously monitor ATP efflux from phosphorylating mitochondria caused by externally added ADP, by photometrically following the NADP+ reduction which occurs in the presence of glucose, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and effluxed ATP. The NADP+ reduction rate shows hyperbolic dependence on ADP concentration (Km and Vmax values 8.5 +/- 0.87 microM and 20.7 +/- 0.49 nmoles NADP+ reduced/min x mg mitochondrial protein, respectively), and proves to measure the activity of the ADP/ATP translocator as shown by inhibition experiments using atracyloside, powerful inhibitor of this carrier. Irradiation was found to enhance the rate of ADP/ATP antiport, with externally added ADP ranging between 5 and 100 microM. As a result of experiments carried out with mitochondria loaded with either ATP or ADP, the increase in the activity of the ADP/ATP translocator is here proposed to depend on the increase in the electrochemical proton gradient which occurs owing to irradiation of mitochondria.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondrial respiration/oxidative phosphorylation is the main source of energy, in the form of ATP, in the heart under physiological conditions. Different respiratory substrates were used in various experiments during heart perfusion: glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glucose+pyruvate, glucose+lactate, glucose+insulin etc. Also under physiological conditions, the concentration of respiratory substrates/hormones in blood can vary significantly. In the present study, we tested the effect of pyruvate, lactate and insulin (all in the presence of glucose) and glucose (in the presence of pyruvate) on the ATP-producing and -consuming blocks in perfused rat heart, in a system where HR (heart rate) was allowed to vary (no pacing). Changes in RPP (rate-pressure product) and PCr (phosphocreatine) concentration were measured. PAA (Proportional Activation Approach) was used to visualize and quantitatively analyse the data. It was demonstrated that addition of glucose (in the presence of pyruvate) exerted essentially no effect on the system. Insulin (in the presence of glucose) activated only the ATP producer. The most interesting finding is that, in our system, pyruvate and lactate (added in the presence or instead of glucose) activated ATP producer, but significantly inhibited ATP consumer (their effect was quantitatively identical).},

	Abstract = {Results obtained by experimental studies of the ischemic heart have been of tremendous importance for the understanding of physiology, biochemistry and lately also the molecular genetics of the heart. Experimental models in use for the study of the ischemic heart involve studies on the integrated organism, experiments with isolated hearts or multicellular preparation, and also studies of cells isolated from the heart. Regional ischemia in the anaesthetized animal has been a standard model. Knowledge about infarct size limitation as well as heart function in acute and chronic ischemia has been obtained based on experiments in a wide variety of species. The isolated perfused heart has been subjected to extensive use. As a result, the understanding of intracellular processes is constantly developing. Cell models and transgenic-mice models represent promising additions. Each model and each species has certain advantages and disadvantages. Variability in susceptibility towards ischemia and reperfusion is also present. The consequences of ischemia can be described as contractile dysfunction and stunning, arrhythmia and infarction each representing different endpoints of injury. The experimental model is also heavily dependent on the endpoint that is chosen for the study. Results obtained in one experimental model can, therefore, not be generalized into universal conclusions about the ischemic heart. With respect to the human and the disease caused by myocardial ischemia, fragments of knowledge put together from different types of experimental models create the background for successful design of potential treatment.},

	Abstract = {The aim was to determine whether adaptation to chronic hypoxia protects the heart against ischemic arrhythmias and whether ATP-dependent potassium channels (K(ATP)) play a role in the antiarrhythmic mechanism. Adult male rats were adapted to intermittent high altitude hypoxia (5000 m, 4 h/day) and susceptibility to ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias was evaluated in the Langendorff-perfused hearts subjected to either an occlusion of the coronary artery for 30 min or pre-conditioning by brief occlusion of the same artery prior to 30-min reocclusion. In separate groups, either a K(ATP) blocker, glibenclamide (10 micromol/l), or a mitochondrial K(ATP) opener, diazoxide (50 micromol/l), were added to a perfusion medium 20 min before the occlusion. Adaptation to hypoxia reduced the total number of ventricular arrhythmias by 64\% as compared with normoxic controls. Preconditioning by a single 3-min coronary artery occlusion was antiarrhythmic only in the normoxic group, while two occlusion periods of 5 min each were needed to pre-condition the hypoxic hearts. Glibenclamide increased the number of arrhythmias in the normoxic hearts from 1316+/-215 to 2091+/-187 (by 59\%) and in the hypoxic group from 636+/-103 to 1777+/-186 (by 179\%). In contrast, diazoxide decreased the number of arrhythmias only in the normoxic group from 1374+/-96 to 582+/-149 (by 58\%), while its effect in the hypoxic group was not significant. It is concluded that long-term adaptation of rats to high altitude hypoxia decreases the susceptibility of their hearts to ischemic arrhythmias and increases an antiarrhythmic threshold of pre-conditioning. The mitochondrial K(ATP) channel, rather than the sarcolemmal K(ATP) channel, appears to be involved in the protective mechanism afforded by adaptation.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Myocardial adaptation has been reported to result from mild but chronic ischaemia in the hearts of patients with coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the responses of the chronically hypoxic myocardium to an episode of severe ischaemia, or the effects of acute ischaemic preconditioning on myocardial function after subsequent fatal ischaemia, may differ between the normoxic and the chronically hypoxic myocardium. METHODS: A rat model of three week hypoxia (10\% O2) was used to simulate tissue hypoxia caused by chronic ischaemia. In isolated isovolumetrically contracting hearts perfused with oxygenated erythrocyte-containing Tyrode solution, systolic and diastolic functions during a 15 or 20 min period of ischaemia and reperfusion were measured in the normoxic control and chronically hypoxic groups. RESULTS: Increases in diastolic pressure during ischaemia were smaller and the recovery of developed pressure during reperfusion was greater in the chronically hypoxic group than in the normoxic group. The hearts of the normoxic group never recovered from ischaemic damage after 20 min ischaemia. The beneficial effects of acute preconditioning with 5 min ischaemia on myocardial function were observed after 15 min ischaemia in the normoxic group, and during and after 20 min ischaemia in the chronically hypoxic group. Changes in lactate production and high energy phosphates could not explain the increased tolerance to ischaemia in the chronically hypoxic group. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic hypoxia increased myocardial tolerance to ischaemia, and acute ischaemic preconditioning increased the tolerance further. Thus chronic hypoxia and acute ischaemic preconditioning independently activate protective mechanisms against ischaemia; the mechanisms may differ between the two types of insult.},

Besides ischemic preconditioning as a powerful temporal protective phenomenon, adaptation to chronic hypoxia also increases cardiac tolerance to all major deleterious consequences of acute oxygen deprivation such as myocardial infarction, contractile dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias. Although many factors have been proposed to play a potential role, the detailed mechanism of this long-term protection remains poorly understood.

	Abstract = {In the exercising muscle, acute reduction in ambient oxygen impairs muscle contraction because of the effects of hypoxia on mitochondrial ATP supply. The less marked impairment reported after long-term exposure to hypoxia points to changes in the regulation of the energetic system of contraction in HC (hypoxic conditioned) animals. This energetic system is conceptually defined here as two modules: the ATP/PCr (phosphocreatine)-producer and the ATP/PCr-consumer connected by energetic intermediates. Modular control analysis that combines top-down control analysis with non-invasive 31P-NMR spectroscopy was used to describe the effects of hypoxia on each module and their adaptation. Modulations of steady levels of ATP turnover (indirectly assessed as force output) and muscle PCr were obtained in HC rats (6 weeks at 10.5\% O2) compared with N (normoxic) rats. Modular control and regulation analyses quantified the elasticity to PCr of each module in N and HC rats as well as the direct effect of acute hypoxia on the ATP/PCr-producer module. Similar elasticities in N and HC rats indicate the absence of response to long-term hypoxia in internal regulations of the ATP supply and demand pathways. The less marked impairment of contraction by acute hypoxia in HC rats (-9+/-6\% versus -17+/-14\% in N rats, P<0.05) was therefore fully explained by a lower direct effect (HC -31+/-13\% versus N -44+/-23\%, P<0.05) of acute hypoxia on mitochondrial ATP supply. This points to a positive adaptation to chronic hypoxia. Modular control analysis in vivo may provide powerful tools to find out improved function (alternatively dysfunction) at the system level in conditioned animals.},

	Abstract = {We used (31)P MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) measurements of energetic intermediates [ATP, P(i) and PCr (phosphocreatine)] in combination with the analytical tools of metabolic control analysis to study in vivo energy metabolism in the contracting skeletal muscle of anaesthetized rats over a broad range of workload. According to our recent MoCA (modular control analysis) used to describe regulatory mechanisms in beating heart, we defined the energetic system of muscle contraction as two modules (PCr-Producer and PCr-Consumer) connected by the energetic intermediates. Hypoxia and electrical stimulation were used in this in vivo study as reasonably selective modulations of Producer and Consumer respectively. As quantified by elasticity coefficients, the sensitivities of each module to PCr determine the control of steady-state contractile activity and metabolite concentrations. The magnitude of the elasticity of the producer was high (4.3+/-0.6) at low workloads and decreased 5-fold (to 0.9+/-0.2) at high workloads. By contrast, the elasticity of the consumer remained low (0.5-1.2) over the range of metabolic rates studied. The control exerted by each module over contraction was calculated from these elasticities. The control of contraction was found on the consumer at low workloads and then swung to the producer, due to the workload-dependent decrease in the elasticity of producer. The workload-dependent elasticity and control pattern of energy production in muscle is a major difference from heart. Since module rate and elasticity depend on the concentrations of substrates and products, the absence of homoeostasis of the energetic intermediates in muscle, by contrast with heart, is probably the origin of the workload-dependent elasticity of the producer module.},

Volume densities of mitochondria, myofibrils, and cytoplasm were determined using morphometry. It was found that the content of mitochondria differs in various species ranging between 22.0-37.0\%. It is a very specific and constant value for any particular species, the smallest having the highest content. A close correlation exists between the mitochondrial volume density, heart rate and the rate of basal oxygen consumption in any group of animals. The myofibrillar volume density shows no species variability. It was about 60.0\% in all species. It is concluded that the mitochondrial volume density is a good indicator of the oxidative capacity of cardiac muscle and that the species specific normal ultrastructural myocyte composition should be a useful baseline in pathophysiological studies of the heart in various animals.},

	Abstract = {Control and regulation of mitochondrial and cellular respiration by oxygen is discussed with three aims: (1) A review of intracellular oxygen levels and gradients, particularly in heart, emphasizes the dominance of extracellular oxygen gradients. Intracellular oxygen pressure, pO2, is low, typically one to two orders of magnitude below incubation conditions used routinely for the study of respiratory control in isolated mitochondria. The pO2 range of respiratory control by oxygen overlaps with cellular oxygen profiles, indicating the significance of pO2 in actual metabolic regulation. (2) A methodologically detailed discussion of high-resolution respirometry is necessary for the controversial topic of respiratory control by oxygen, since the risk of methodological artefact is closely connected with far-reaching theoretical implications. Instrumental and analytical errors may mask effects of energetic state and partially explain the divergent views on the regulatory role of intracellular pO2. Oxygen pressure for half-maximum respiration, p50, in isolated mitochondria at state 4 was 0.025 kPa (0.2 Torr; 0.3 microM O2), whereas p50 in endothelial cells was 0.06-0.08 kPa (0.5 Torr). (3) A model derived from the thermodynamics of irreversible processes was developed which quantitatively accounts for near-hyperbolic flux/pO2 relations in isolated mitochondria. The apparent p50 is a function of redox potential and protonmotive force. The protonmotive force collapses after uncoupling and consequently causes a decrease in p50. Whereas it is becoming accepted that flux control is shared by several enzymes, insufficient attention is paid to the notion of complementary kinetic and thermodynamic flux control mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {A complete description of the regulation of metabolism in even a single cell will be very hard to achieve, enormous and indigestible. However, there are two powerful ways to simplify the complexity. Firstly, related processes and intermediates can be grouped into a small number of modules, and the regulation of the simplified system can be studied. Secondly, control analysis can be used. With these simplifications to illuminate the important regulatory features, even a full description could be made intellectually and experimentally accessible without distorting the essential regulatory features. Modular control analysis is powerful because it can quantify the relative importance of different flows of regulatory information through any metabolic, physiological, signalling or transcriptional network. It can answer global questions about the importance of different pathways mediating any change to a system. It has been used to analyse how cadmium, a poison with multiple effects, changes oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria, and to quantify the regulation of energy metabolism in hepatocytes. It has been used to measure how energy metabolism is regulated during mitogen stimulation of thymocytes, quantifying the relative importance of different signalling pathways and how each pathway contributes to the activation of energy metabolism. Recently, we have applied modular control analysis to modern DNA microarray expression profiling to measure the importance of different groups of mRNA transcripts in mediating physiological responses.},

@article{Gibbs:2007zr,
	Abstract = {The myocardium is well protected against chronic hypoxia. In chronic hypoxia stroke volume falls both at rest and on exercise. The fall in stroke volume is associated with reduction in left ventricular dimensions and filling pressure. An obvious explanation for this is the reduction in plasma volume observed at high altitude, but this does not appear to be the whole story. Neither is left ventricular systolic function abnormal even at the summit of Mount Everest. Hypoxia itself may have a direct effect on impairing myocardial relaxation. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance leads to right ventricular pressure overload. This may impair right ventricular function, and reduce stroke volume and venous return to the left atrium. Interaction between the right and left ventricles, which share a common septum and are potentially constrained in volume by the pericardium, may impair diastolic left ventricular filling as a consequence of right ventricular pressure overload, and hence reduce stroke volume. It is questionable how clinically significant is this left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The relative importance of different mechanisms which reduce stroke volume probably depends whether hemodynamics are measured at rest or on exercise. Intervention with sildenafil to ameliorate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is associated with both an increase in exercise capacity and stroke volume in hypoxia. Whether these have a causal association remains to be demonstrated.},

	Abstract = {Changes in contractile force of the myocardium may depend on changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, changes in the responsiveness of the myofibrils for Ca2+, or a combination of both. We investigated in isolated muscle strip preparations from human nonfailing and endstage failing hearts the influence of physical (changes in preload, stimulation rate, or rhythm), and pharmacological interventions (alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor-stimulation, endothelin) on developed force of contraction and the corresponding intracellular Ca2+ transients. METHODS: Isometric contraction, electrical stimulation, 37 degrees C. Simultaneous registration of force of contraction and intracellular Ca2+ transients (aequorin method). RESULTS: Increases in preload, alpha- and endothelin-receptor stimulation resulted in increases in force of contraction without increasing aequorin light emission. Increasing stimulation rate or increasing rest intervals resulted in parallel increases (nonfailing myocardium) or decreases (failing myocardium) of force of contraction and aequorin light emission. beta-Adrenoceptor-stimulation exerted inotropic and lusitropic effects in human failing myocardium associated with a large, overproportional increase in aequorin light emission. CONCLUSION: The human heart regulates intrinsic contractility via several subcellular mechanisms. Increases in preload (Frank-Starling-mechanism) and alpha- or endothelin-receptor-stimulation enhance myocardial contractility by increasing the Ca2+ responsiveness of the myofilaments; rate- and rhythm-dependent modulation of the contractile state directly depend on changes in the intracellular Ca(2+)-transients; beta-adrenoceptor stimulation results in an overproportional large increase in intracellular Ca2+ transients, probably due to additional cAMP-dependent Ca(2+)-desensitizing effects on the level of the myofibrils.},

	Abstract = {The Frank-Starling law of the heart applies to all classes of vertebrates. It describes how stretch of cardiac muscle, up to an optimum length, increases contractility thereby linking cardiac ejection to cardiac filling. The cellular mechanisms underlying the Frank-Starling response include an increase in myofilament sensitivity for Ca2+, decreased myofilament lattice spacing and increased thin filament cooperativity. Stretching of mammalian, amphibian and fish cardiac myocytes reveal that the functional peak of the sarcomere length (SL)-tension relationship occurs at longer SL in the non-mammalian classes. These findings correlate with in vivo cardiac function as non-mammalian vertebrates, such as fish, vary stroke volume to a relatively larger extent than mammals. Thus, it seems the length-dependent properties of individual myocytes are modified to accommodate differences in organ function, and the high extensibility of certain hearts is matched by the extensibility of their myocytes. Reasons for the differences between classes are still to be elucidated, however, the structure of mammalian ventricular myocytes, with larger widths and higher levels of passive stiffness than those from other vertebrate classes may be implicated.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have questioned whether there is an improved cardiac function after high-altitude training. Accordingly, the present study was designed specifically to test whether this apparent blunted response of the whole heart to training can be accounted for by altered mechanical properties at the cellular level. METHODS: Adult rats were trained for 5 weeks under normoxic (N, NT for sedentary and trained animals, respectively) or hypobaric hypoxic (H, HT) conditions. Cardiac morphology and function were evaluated by echocardiography. Calcium Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile machinery was estimated in skinned cardiomyocytes isolated from the left ventricular (LV) sub-epicardium (Epi) and sub-endocardium (Endo) at short and long sarcomere lengths (SL). RESULTS: Cardiac remodelling was harmonious (increase in wall thickness with chamber dilatation) in NT rats and disharmonious (hypertrophy without chamber dilatation) in HT rats. Contrary to NT rats, HT rats did not exhibit enhancement in global cardiac performance evaluated by echocardiography. Stretch- dependent Ca2+ sensitization of the myofilaments (cellular index of the Frank-Starling mechanism) increased from Epi to Endo in N rats. Training in normoxic conditions further increased this stretch-dependent Ca2+ sensitization. Chronic hypoxia did not significantly affect myofibrilar Ca2+ sensitivity. In contrast, high-altitude training decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments at both SL, mostly in Endo cells, resulting in a loss of the transmural gradient of the stretch-dependent Ca2+ sensitization. Expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms was affected both by training and chronic hypoxia but did not correlate with mechanical data. CONCLUSIONS: Training at sea level increased the transmural gradient of stretch-dependent Ca2+ sensitization of the myofilaments, accounting for an improved Frank-Starling mechanism. High-altitude training depressed myofilament response to Ca2+, especially in the Endo layer. This led to a reduction in this transmural gradient that may contribute to the lack of improvement in LV function via the Frank-Starling mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Systems biology is an emerging discipline focused on tackling the enormous intellectual and technical challenges associated with translating genome sequence into a comprehensive understanding of how organisms are built and run. Physiology and systems biology share the goal of understanding the integrated function of complex, multicomponent biological systems ranging from interacting proteins that carry out specific tasks to whole organisms. Despite this common ground, physiology as an academic discipline runs the real risk of fading into the background and being superseded organizationally and administratively by systems biology. My goal in this article is to discuss briefly the cornerstones of modern systems biology, specifically functional genomics, nonmammalian model organisms and computational biology, and to emphasize the need to embrace them as essential components of 21st-century physiology departments and research and teaching programs.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK) co-localizes with mitochondrial porin (voltage-dependent anion channel) and adenine nucleotide translocator in mitochondrial contact sites. A specific, direct protein-protein interaction between MtCK and mitochondrial porin was demonstrated using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. This interaction was independent of the immobilized binding partner (porin reconstituted in liposomes or MtCK) or the analyzed isoform (chicken sarcomeric MtCK or human ubiquitous MtCK, human recombinant porin, or purified bovine porin). Increased ionic strength reduced the binding of MtCK to porin, suggesting predominantly ionic interactions. By contrast, micromolar concentrations of Ca(2+) increased the amount of bound MtCK, indicating a physiological regulation of complex formation. No interaction of MtCK with reconstituted adenine nucleotide translocator was detectable in our experimental setup. The relevance of these findings for structure and function of mitochondrial contact sites is discussed.},

@article{Neubauer:1995vn,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that energy metabolism is impaired in residual intact myocardium of chronically infarcted rat heart, contributing to contractile dysfunction. Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in rats by coronary artery ligation. Hearts were isolated 8 wk later and buffer-perfused isovolumically. MI hearts showed reduced left ventricular developed pressure, but oxygen consumption was unchanged. High-energy phosphate contents were measured chemically and by 31P-NMR spectroscopy. In residual intact left ventricular tissue, ATP was unchanged after MI, while creatine phosphate was reduced by 31\%. Total creatine kinase (CK) activity was reduced by 17\%, the fetal CK isoenzymes BB and MB increased, while the "adult" mitochondrial CK isoenzyme activity decreased by 44\%. Total creatine content decreased by 35\%. Phosphoryl exchange between ATP and creatine phosphate, measured by 31P-NMR magnetization transfer, fell by 50\% in MI hearts. Thus, energy reserve is substantially impaired in residual intact myocardium of chronically infarcted rats. Because phosphoryl exchange was still five times higher than ATP synthesis rates calculated from oxygen consumption, phosphoryl transfer via CK may not limit baseline contractile performance 2 mo after MI. In contrast, when MI hearts were subjected to acute stress (hypoxia), mechanical recovery during reoxygenation was impaired, suggesting that reduced energy reserve contributes to increased susceptibility of MI hearts to acute metabolic stress.},

	Abstract = {Using an isolated ferret heart preparation (Langendorff perfusion, perfusion pressure 90 mmHg), energy metabolism has been characterized in right and left ventricles from control and hypertrophied hearts. Hypertrophy was induced by pulmonary artery clipping for 30-45 days (right ventricle wall weight/body weight ratio increased by 70\%). Myocardial contents of high energy phosphate compounds, glycogen and lactate, and the activities of some enzymes were biochemically measured in perfused hearts and also after ischemic arrest (30 min global ischemia). In hypertrophied right ventricles, PCr (-46\%), Cr (-34\%) levels, creatine kinase activity (-18\%) were significantly decreased compared with control. ATP and Pi levels were not affected by hypertrophy. The adenylate energy charges were similar (0.85-0.86) in both types of heart. The activities of hexokinase (+26\%), aldolase (+212\%), pyruvate kinase (+14\%) and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (+107\%) were increased by hypertrophy. The LDH isozyme pattern was significantly changed such that LDH3 was decreased by 11\%, and LDH4 and LDH5 were increased by a factor 1.4 and 2.9 respectively in hypertrophy. After 30 min of global ischemia, PCr level was decreased by 89 and 79\% in control and hypertrophied ventricles respectively. ATP level was depressed by 41 in control and only by 21\% in hypertrophied muscles. Altogether, the present data suggested that, in the adult ferret heart, the capacity for the ATP synthesis could be maintained during hypertrophy by the enhancement of the glycolytic pathway. The smaller decline of ATP after ischemia in hypertrophied tissue could be explained by a lower consumption of ATP in the hypertrophied compared to the control heart during the earliest period of ischemia.},

	Abstract = {Little information is available on the mechanism of diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in patients with chronic respiratory disease complicated by hypoxia. The purpose of this study was to investigate how chronic hypoxia impairs LV diastolic function in an hypoxic animal model. Thirty-six male Wistar rats 8 weeks old were assigned to normoxia (N), chronic hypoxia (CH), and re-normoxia (RN) groups, 12 rats per group. The N group rats were kept in ambient air for 8 weeks, while the CH group was kept hypoxic for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of hypoxia the RN group rats were kept for a further 8 weeks in ambient air. LV systolic and diastolic functions, as well as right ventricular (RV) function, were analyzed using Doppler echocardiography;we also measured the hematocrit, and weighed the LV and RV. Hematocrit, RV weight/body weight, and RV weight/LV weight were higher in the CH group than in the other 2 groups. However, most of these parameters returned to normoxia levels after re-normoxia. In the CH group, LV dimension and area were smaller than in the other 2 groups. LV systolic function was preserved in all groups;however, in the CH group, mitral flow showed a restrictive pattern, while pulmonary flow demonstrated a pulmonary hypertensive pattern with prolonged RV ejection time. In conclusion, chronic hypoxia induced pulmonary hypertension and RV hypertrophy. Although LV systolic function was preserved, diastolic function was impaired in hypoxia. Ventricular interaction may impair LV diastolic function.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adaptation to chronic exposure to hypoxia alters energy metabolism in the heart, particularly in the left ventricle, which undergoes a loss in oxidative capacity. Highly lipophilic local anesthetics interfere with mitochondrial energy metabolism. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of bupivacaine on mitochondrial energy metabolism in heart of rats subjected to normoxic or hypoxic environments. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 10) were subjected to hypobaric hypoxia (simulated altitude = 5,000 m, 380 mmHg) for 2 weeks. Control rats (n = 10) were maintained in an ambient normoxic environment. Mitochondrial metabolism (oxygen consumption and adenosine triphosphate synthesis) was assessed using saponin-skinned ventricular fibers. Bupivacaine (0-5 mM) was tested on both left and right ventricles of normoxic or hypoxic heart. RESULTS: In animals exposed to hypobaric hypoxia for 14 days, cardiac mass significantly increased, and the right-to-left ventricular ratio was approximately twofold (0.48 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.04, P < 0.05). Oxygen consumption and adenosine triphosphate synthesis were significantly lower in the hypoxic left ventricles but not in the right ones. The uncoupling effect of bupivacaine was more pronounced in the left ventricle from hypoxic heart than in the right ventricle; the bupivacaine-induced decrease in the adenosine triphosphate synthesis rate and in the adenosine triphosphate-to-oxygen ratio was significantly greater in the hypoxic left ventricle than in the normoxic one. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic hypoxia impairs cardiac energy metabolism in left ventricles and enhances the depressant effects of bupivacaine on mitochondrial functions.},

	Abstract = {In this review, we examine cardiovascular metabolism from three different, but highly complementary, perspectives. First, from the abstract perspective of a metabolite network, composed of nodes and links. We present fundamental concepts in network theory, including emergence, to illustrate how nature has designed metabolism with a hierarchal modular scale-free topology to provide a robust system of energy delivery. Second, from the physical perspective of a modular spatially compartmentalized network. We review evidence that cardiovascular metabolism is functionally compartmentalized, such that oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and glycogenolysis preferentially channel ATP to ATPases in different cellular compartments, using creatine kinase and adenylate kinase to maximize efficient energy delivery. Third, from the dynamics perspective, as a network of dynamically interactive metabolic modules capable of self-oscillation. Whereas normally, cardiac metabolism exists in a regime in which excitation-metabolism coupling closely matches energy supply and demand, we describe how under stressful conditions, the network can be pushed into a qualitatively new dynamic regime, manifested as cell-wide oscillations in ATP levels, in which the coordination between energy supply and demand is lost. We speculate how this state of "metabolic fibrillation" leads to cell death if not corrected and discuss the implications for cardioprotection.},

	Abstract = {To explore the mechanisms underlying the shortening of the cardiac action potential in hypoxia, we studied the effect of hypoxia on the ionic currents in cat papillary and trabecular muscles using the single sucrose gap-voltage clamp technique. For potentials positive to -70 mV, hypoxia induces an increase in time-independent outward current. The changes in the tail current suggest that time-dependent outward current is not increased but, rather, reduced. Because the time course of ik remains unchanged, we concluded that the shortening of the action potential is not a result of a change in the time-dependent outward current. In the potential range of the plateau, the amplitude of the slow inward current is not affected by hpoxia. Its time constant of inactivation appears slightly decreased. The prolongation of the action potential by epinephrine during hypoxia is accompanied by an increase in the slow inward current. As a result of these studies, we conclude that the shortening of the cardiac action potential in the early stage of hypoxia results from an increase in K+ outward background current.},

	Abstract = {The NMR technique of magnetization transfer can be used to define intracellular reaction kinetics. In order to determine the relationship between ATP synthesis and flux through the creatine kinase reaction in the intact heart, we used this technique to measure flux through the creatine kinase reaction in the isolated, isovolumic rat heart at five levels of cardiac performance and oxygen consumption. The unidirectional reaction rate constants (s-1) calculated from a two-site exchange model for both the forward and reverse creatine kinase reactions increased with cardiac performance and oxygen consumption. As the rate-pressure product varied from 0 to 44.7 X 10(3) mm Hg/min and oxygen consumption rose from 5.9 to 45.8 mumol of O2/g dry weight/min, kforward increased from 0.27 to 1.30 and kreverse increased from 0.31 to 1.14. The relationship between creatine kinase flux and oxygen consumption, and thus ATP synthesis, took the form of the Michaelis-Menten equation. Rates of ATP synthesis estimated from magnetization transfer were similar to values calculated from oxygen consumption. The longitudinal relaxation time of creatine phosphate (2.06 s), the gamma-phosphorus atom of ATP (0.75 s), and inorganic phosphate (0.81 s) did not change with cardiac performance. These results show that myocardial energy transfer via the creatine kinase reaction is closely coupled to energy production.},

This is by virtue of the unique sensitivity of the outer membrane CPT I to the simple molecule, malonyl-CoA. In addition, both CPT I and the inner membrane enzyme, CPT II, have proved to be loci of inherited defects, some with disastrous consequences. Early efforts using classical approaches to characterize the CPT proteins in terms of structure/function/regulatory relationships gave rise to confusion and protracted debate. By contrast, recent application of molecular biological tools has brought major enlightenment at an exponential pace. Here we review some key developments of the last 20 years that have led to our current understanding of the physiology of the CPT system, the structure of the CPT isoforms, the chromosomal localization of their respective genes, and the identification of mutations in the human population.},

	Abstract = {The heart utilizes fatty acids as a substrate in preference to glucose for the production of energy. The rate of fatty acid uptake and oxidation by heart muscle is controlled by the availability of exogenous fatty acids, the rate of acyl translocation across the mitochondrial membrane and the rate of acetyl-CoA oxidation by the citric acid cycle. Carnitine acyl-CoA transferase appears to have an important function in coupling the fatty acid activation and acyl transfer to the oxidative phosphorylation. Activated fatty acids are also utilized for the synthesis of triglycerides and membrane phospholipids in the myocardium. The inhibition of long chain acyl-carnitine transferase I reduces the oxidation of fatty acids and promotes the synthesis of lipids in the myocardium. Accumulation of fatty acids and their metabolites such as long chain acyl-CoA and long chain acyl-carnitine has been associated with cardiac dysfunction and cell damage in both ischemic and diabetic hearts. Alterations in the composition of membrane phospholipids are also considered to change the activities of various membrane bound enzymes and subsequently heart function under different pathophysiological conditions. Chronic diabetes was found to be associated with increased plasma lipids, subcellular defects and cardiac dysfunction. Lowering the plasma lipids or reducing the oxidation of fatty acids by agents such as etomoxir, an inhibitor of palmitoylcarnitine transferase I was found to promote glucose utilization and remodel the subcellular membranous organelles in the heart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to study the effect of intramitochondrial acyl-CoA on the respiration of rabbit heart mitochondria over the whole range of stationary respiratory rates between States 4 and 3. The creatine phosphokinase system was used for stabilization of extramitochondrial adenine nucleotide concentration. It was shown that acyl-CoA depressed respiration more effectively in the intermediate range of respiration between States 4 and 3. The effect of acyl-CoA was negligible near State 4 and in State 3. These data are in line with our previous results concerning the dependence of the adenine nucleotide translocator control coefficient on the rate of mitochondrial respiration. Thus, our data suggest that long-chain acyl-CoA may regulate oxidative phosphorylation in heart mitochondria in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Cardiac failure appears rapidly during severe hypoxia and precedes a substantial reduction in adenosine triphosphate content. Reduced adenosine triphosphate turnover, in the presence of nearly normal content, may be the metabolic basis for contractile failure during hypoxia. To measure both the myocardial content and the turnover rates of high-energy phosphate compounds during hypoxia, we performed 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance studies by placing a surface coil directly over the left ventricle in intubated rats that were instrumented for hemodynamic measurements and ventilated with either 21, 10, or 8\% O2. Normoxia produced a hemodynamic and metabolic steady state for 4 hours and hypoxia for at least 60 minutes. Under normoxic ventilation (n = 10, mean +/- SD), the arterial PO2 was 96 +/- 14, pH 7.38 +/- 0.11, and systolic blood pressure 96 +/- 8 mm Hg; under hypoxic ventilation with 10\% O2 (n = 5), the arterial PO2 was 57 +/- 10, pH 7.39 +/- 0.09, and systolic pressure 68 +/- 10; and under hypoxic ventilation with 8\% O2 (n = 5), the PO2 was 52 +/- 7, pH 7.37 +/- 0.04, and systolic pressure 51 +/- 4. Hypoxic ventilation with 10 or 8\% O2 decreased the creatine phosphate content from 51.4 +/- 5.4 mumol/g dry wt to 39.3 +/- 5.4 and 45.6 +/- 4.1 and depressed adenosine triphosphate slightly from 25.0 mumol/g dry wt to 21.8 +/- 2.1 and 21.9 +/- 1.0, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The effects of exogenous fatty acids and hypoxia on cardiac energy metabolism were studied by measuring mitochondrial and cytosolic adenine nucleotides as well as CoA and carnitine esters using a tissue fractionation technique in non-aqueous solvents. During normoxia, the administration of 0.5 mM palmitate caused a considerable increase in acyl-CoA and acylcarnitine, particularly in mitochondria. High-energy phosphates, however, were only slightly altered. A 90 min low-flow hypoxia caused a dramatic increase in mitochondrial acyl esters. The mitochondrial ATP content decreased significantly, while the cytosolic concentration was only slightly diminished, suggesting an inhibition of mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocation by long-chain acyl-CoA. Addition of palmitate during hypoxia amplified hypoxic damage and reduced adenine nucleotides in both compartments considerably, while fatty acid metabolites were only slightly affected. In presence of an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation (BM 42.304), the fatty-acid-induced acceleration of cardiac injury was prevented. Since BM 42.304 decreased mitochondrial acylcarnitine and increased the cytosolic concentration significantly, BM 42.304 was presumed to inhibit mitochondrial acylcarnitine translocase. However, a causal relationship between lipid metabolites and ischemic damage seemed unlikely.},

	Abstract = {The origin of significant differences between the apparent affinities of heart mitochondrial respiration for exogenous ADP in isolated mitochondria in vitro and in permeabilized cardiomyocytes or skinned fibres in situ is critically analysed. All experimental data demonstrate the importance of structural factors of intracellular arrangement of mitochondria into functional complexes with myofibrils and sarcoplasmic reticulum in oxidative muscle cells and the control of outer mitochondrial membrane permeability. It has been shown that the high apparent K(m) for exogenous ADP (250-350 mM) in permeabilized cells and in ghost cells (without myosin) and fibres (diameter 15-20 mm) is independent of intrinsic MgATPase activity. However, the K(m) may be decreased significantly by a selective proteolytic treatment, which also destroys the regular arrangement of mitochondria between sarcomeres and increases the accessibility of endogenous ADP to the exogenous pyruvate kinase-phosphoenolpyruvate system. The confocal microscopy was used to study the changes in intracellular distribution of mitochondria and localization of cytoskeletal proteins, such as desmin, tubulin and plectin in permeabilized cardiac cells during short proteolytic treatment. The results show the rapid collapse of microtubular and plectin networks but not of desmin localization under these conditions. These results point to the participation of cytoskeletal proteins in the intracellular organization and control of mitochondrial function in the cells in vivo, where mitochondria are incorporated into functional complexes with sarcomeres and sarcoplasmic reticulum.},

	Abstract = {To understand how cardiac ATP and CrP remain stable with changes in work rate - a phenomenon that has eluded mechanistic explanation for decades - data from (31)phosphate-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS) are analysed to estimate cytoplasmic and mitochondrial phosphate metabolite concentrations in the normal state, during high cardiac workstates, during acute ischaemia and reactive hyperaemic recovery. Analysis is based on simulating distributed heterogeneous oxygen transport in the myocardium integrated with a detailed model of cardiac energy metabolism. The model predicts that baseline myocardial free inorganic phosphate (P(i)) concentration in the canine myocyte cytoplasm - a variable not accessible to direct non-invasive measurement - is approximately 0.29 mm and increases to 2.3 mm near maximal cardiac oxygen consumption. During acute ischaemia (from ligation of the left anterior descending artery) P(i) increases to approximately 3.1 mm and ATP consumption in the ischaemic tissue is reduced quickly to less than half its baseline value before the creatine phosphate (CrP) pool is 18\% depleted. It is determined from these experiments that the maximal rate of oxygen consumption of the heart is an emergent property and is limited not simply by the maximal rate of ATP synthesis, but by the maximal rate at which ATP can be synthesized at a potential at which it can be utilized. The critical free energy of ATP hydrolysis for cardiac contraction that is consistent with these findings is approximately -63.5 kJ mol(-1). Based on theoretical findings, we hypothesize that inorganic phosphate is both the primary feedback signal for stimulating oxidative phosphorylation in vivo and also the most significant product of ATP hydrolysis in limiting the capacity of the heart to hydrolyse ATP in vivo. Due to the lack of precise quantification of P(i) in vivo, these hypotheses and associated model predictions remain to be carefully tested experimentally.},

	Abstract = {Computational models of a large metabolic system can be assembled from modules that represent a biological function emerging from interaction of a small subset of molecules. A "skeleton model" is tested here for a module that regulates the first phase of dynamic adaptation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to demand in heart muscle cells. The model contains only diffusion, mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) permeation, and two isoforms of creatine kinase (CK), in cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), respectively. The communication with two neighboring modules occurs via stimulation of mitochondrial ATP production by ADP and P(i) from the IMS and via time-varying cytosolic ATP hydrolysis during contraction. Assuming normal cytosolic diffusion and high MOM permeability for ADP, the response time of OxPhos (t(mito); generalized time constant) to steps in cardiac pacing rate is predicted to be 2.4 s. In contrast, with low MOM permeability, t(mito) is predicted to be 15 s. An optimized MOM permeability of 21 mum/s gives t(mito) = 3.7 s, in agreement with experiments on rabbit heart with blocked glycolytic ATP synthesis. The model correctly predicts a lower t(mito) if CK activity is reduced by 98\%. Among others, the following predictions result from the model analysis: 1) CK activity buffers large ADP oscillations; 2) ATP production is pulsatile in beating heart, although it adapts slowly to demand with "time constant" approximately 14 heartbeats; 3) if the muscle isoform of CK is overexpressed, OxPhos reacts slower to changing workload; and 4) if mitochondrial CK is overexpressed, OxPhos reacts faster.},

A transient NMR spin-transfer method was developed, tested, and applied to resting and stimulated ex vivo muscle, the soleus, which is a cellularly homogeneous slow-twitch mammalian muscle, to measure creatine kinase kinetics. The forward and reverse unidirectional CK fluxes were equal, being 1.6 mM.s-1 in unstimulated muscle at 22 degrees C, and 2.7 mM.s-1 at 30 degrees C. The CK fluxes did not differ during steady-state stimulation conditions giving a 10-fold range of ATPase rates in which the ATP/PCr ratio increased from approximately 0.3 to 1.6. The observed kinetic behavior of CK activity in the muscle was that expected from the enzyme in vitro in a homogeneous solution only if account was taken of inhibition by an anion-stabilized quaternary dead-end enzyme complex: E.Cr.MgADP.anion.

	Abstract = {Understanding muscle energetics is a problem in optimizing supply of ATP to the demands of ATPases. The complexity of reactions and their fluxes to achieve this balance is greatly reduced by recognizing constraints imposed by the integration of common metabolites at fixed stoichiometry among modular units. ATPase is driven externally. Oxidative phosphorylation and glycogenolysis are the suppliers. We focus on their regulation which involves different controls, but reduces to two principles that enable facile experimental analysis of the supply and demand fluxes. The ratio of concentration of phosphocreatine (PCr) to ATP, not their individual values, sets the range of achievable concentrations of ADP in resting and active muscle (at fixed pH) in different cell types. This principle defines the fraction of available flux of oxidative phosphorylation utilized (at fixed enzyme activities). Then the kinetics of PCr recovery defines the kinetics of oxygen supply and substrate utilization. The second principle is the constancy of PCr and H(+) (lactate) production by glycogenolysis due to the coupling of ATPase and glycolysis. This principle enables glycogenolytic flux to be measured from intracellular proton loads. Further simplification occurs because the magnitude of the interacting fluxes and metabolite concentrations are specified within narrow limits when both the resting and active fluxes are quantified. Thus there is a small set of rules for assessing and understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of muscle energetics.},

	Abstract = {When the mechanical work intensity in muscle increases, the elevated ATP consumption rate must be matched by the rate of ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation in order to avoid a quick exhaustion of ATP. The traditional mechanism of the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, namely the negative feedback involving [ADP] and [Pi] as regulatory signals, is not sufficient to account for various kinetic properties of the system in intact skeletal muscle and heart in vivo. Theoretical studies conducted using a dynamic computer model of oxidative phosphorylation developed previously strongly suggest the so-called each-step-activation (or parallel activation) mechanism, due to which all oxidative phosphorylation complexes are directly activated by some cytosolic factor/mechanism related to muscle contraction in parallel with the activation of ATP usage and substrate dehydrogenation by calcium ions. The present polemic article reviews and discusses the growing evidence supporting this mechanism and compares it with alternative mechanisms proposed in the literature. It is concluded that only the each-step-activation mechanism is able to explain the rich set of various experimental results used as a reference for estimating the validity and applicability of particular mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {A system analysis of ATP free energy metabolism in skeletal muscle was made using the principles of metabolic control theory. We developed a network model of ATP free energy metabolism in muscle consisting of actomyosin ATPase, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase, and mitochondria. These components were sufficient to capture the major aspects of the regulation of the cytosolic ATP-to-ADP concentration ratio (ATP/ADP) in muscle contraction and had inherent homeostatic properties regulating this free energy potential. As input for the analysis, we used ATP metabolic flux and the cytosolic ATP/ADP at steady state at six contraction frequencies between 0 and 2 Hz measured in human forearm flexor muscle by (31)P-NMR spectroscopy. We used the mathematical formalism of metabolic control theory to analyze the distribution of fractional kinetic control of ATPase flux and the ATP/ADP in the network at steady state among the components over this experimental range and an extrapolated range of stimulation frequencies (up to 10 Hz). The control analysis showed that the contractile actomyosin ATPase has dominant kinetic control of ATP flux in forearm flexor muscle over the 0- to 1.6-Hz range of contraction frequencies that resulted in steady states, as determined by (31)P-NMR. However, flux control begins to shift toward mitochondria at >1 Hz. This inversion of flux control from ATP demand to ATP supply control hierarchy progressed as the contraction frequency increased past 2 Hz and was nearly complete at 10 Hz. The functional significance of this result is that, at steady state, ATP free energy consumption cannot outstrip the ATP free energy supply. Therefore, this reduced, three-component muscle ATPase system is inherently homeostatic.},

	Abstract = {Observations on the relationship between cardiac work rate and the levels of energy metabolites adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and phosphocreatine (CrP) have not been satisfactorily explained by theoretical models of cardiac energy metabolism. Specifically, the in vivo stability of ATP, ADP, and CrP levels in response to changes in work and respiratory rate has eluded explanation. Here a previously developed model of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which was developed based on data obtained from isolated cardiac mitochondria, is integrated with a spatially distributed model of oxygen transport in the myocardium to analyze data obtained from several laboratories over the past two decades. The model includes the components of the respiratory chain, the F0F1-ATPase, adenine nucleotide translocase, and the mitochondrial phosphate transporter at the mitochondrial level; adenylate kinase, creatine kinase, and ATP consumption in the cytoplasm; and oxygen transport between capillaries, interstitial fluid, and cardiomyocytes. The integrated model is able to reproduce experimental observations on ATP, ADP, CrP, and inorganic phosphate levels in canine hearts over a range of workload and during coronary hypoperfusion and predicts that cytoplasmic inorganic phosphate level is a key regulator of the rate of mitochondrial respiration at workloads for which the rate of cardiac oxygen consumption is less than or equal to approximately 12 mumol per minute per gram of tissue. At work rates corresponding to oxygen consumption higher than 12 mumol min(-1) g(-1), model predictions deviate from the experimental data, indicating that at high work rates, additional regulatory mechanisms that are not currently incorporated into the model may be important. Nevertheless, the integrated model explains metabolite levels observed at low to moderate workloads and the changes in metabolite levels and tissue oxygenation observed during graded hypoperfusion. These findings suggest that the observed stability of energy metabolites emerges as a property of a properly constructed model of cardiac substrate transport and mitochondrial metabolism. In addition, the validated model provides quantitative predictions of changes in phosphate metabolites during cardiac ischemia.},

After 4 weeks of diabetes, V(max)decreased by 22\% with a larger decrease of CK MB than of CK MM and mitochondrial-CK isoenzymes. There was no further decrease in these parameters after 6 weeks of diabetes. Isovolumic contractile performance of 4 and 6 week diabetic hearts, estimated as rate-pressure product under identical perfusion and loading conditions (EDP set at 6-8 mmHg), was only 50\% of that of control. ATP, PCr and total creatine concentrations were not different in control and 4 or 6 weeks diabetic rat hearts. After 4 weeks of diabetes, CK reaction velocity decreased by 22\%. This was in proportion to the decline of V(max)and therefore predicted by the rate equation for the CK reaction. However, the further decline in the CK reaction velocity after 6 weeks of diabetes (45\%) was greater than that predicted from the CK rate equation (17\% decrease), and cannot be explained by substrate control of the enzyme. When hearts were inotropically stimulated by increasing perfusate calcium concentration, CK reaction velocity increased slightly (approximately 15\%) in both control and diabetic hearts, thereby maintaining a constant ATP concentration. We conclude that in the diabetic myocardium, the CK reaction velocity decreases but does not limit the availability of high-energy phosphates for contraction over the range of workloads studied. We also conclude that a mechanism(s) in addition to substrate control regulates CK reaction velocity in the 6 week diabetic hearts.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate theoretically which intracellular factors may be important for regulation of mitochondrial respiration in working heart cells in vivo. We have developed a model that describes quantitatively the published experimental data on dependence of the rate of oxygen consumption and metabolic state of working isolated perfused rat heart on workload over its physiological range (Williamson JR, Ford G, Illingworth J, Safer B. Circ Res 38, Suppl I, I39-I51, 1976). Analysis of this model shows that for phosphocreatine, creatine, and ATP the equilibrium assumption is an acceptable approximation with respect to their diffusion in the intracellular bulk water phase. However, the ADP concentration changes in the contraction cycle in a nonequilibrium workload-dependent manner, showing the existence of the intracellular concentration gradients. The model shows that workload-dependent alteration of ADP concentration in the compartmentalized creatine kinase system may be taken, together with the changes in P(i) concentration, to be among the major components of the metabolic feedback signal for regulation of respiration in muscle cells.},

	Abstract = {The mathematical model of the compartmentalised energy transfer system in cardiac myocytes, which includes mitochondrial synthesis of ATP by ATP-synthase, phosphocreatine production in the coupled mitochondrial creatine kinase reaction, the myofibrillar and cytoplasmic creatine kinase reactions, ATP utilisation by actomyosin ATPase during contraction cycle, and diffusional exchange of metabolites between different compartments, was used to calculate creatine kinase reaction rates (fluxes) in different cellular compartments at a workload corresponding to the rate of oxygen consumption of 46 micrograms-atom O2 *min-1 * (g wet mass)-1. The results of calculations showed that at this high workload all creatine kinase isoenzymes function most of their time in the cardiac cycle in the steady state far from equilibrium. This mathematical modelling shows that the validity of assumption of creatine kinase equilibrium is limited only to the diastolic phase of the contraction cycle in the working cardiac cells and only to the cytoplasmic compartment. In the systolic phase, due to rapid release of ADP at increased workloads, all creatine kinase isoenzymes are rapidly shifted out of the equilibrium. Cytoplasmic ADP concentration may increase up to 9 times in the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, correspondingly changing all ADP-dependent parameters. Mitochondrial creatine kinase functions permanently in "metastable" steady state (Jurgen Daut, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 895, 41-62, 1987). It may be proposed that a more precise, in comparison to the equilibrium concept, way of calculating steady state cytoplasmic ADP concentrations at increased workloads is to use kinetic equations and mathematical models of energy metabolism.},

	Abstract = {1. In uncoupled rat heart mitochondria, the kinetic parameters for oxoglutarate oxidation were very close to those found for oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity in extracts of the mitochondria. In particular, Ca2+ greatly diminished the Km for oxoglutarate and the k0.5 value (concentration required for half-maximal effect) for this effect of Ca2+ was close to 1 microM. 2. In coupled rat heart mitochondria incubated with ADP, increases in the extramitochondrial concentration of Ca2+ greatly stimulated oxoglutarate oxidation at low concentrations of oxoglutarate, but not at saturating concentrations of oxoglutarate. The k0.5 value for the activation by extramitochondrial Ca2+ was about 20 nM. In the presence of either Mg2+ or Na+ this value was increased to about 90 nM, and in the presence of both to about 325 nM. 3. In coupled rat heart mitochondria incubated without ADP, increases in the extramitochondrial concentration of Ca2+ resulted in increases in the proportion of pyruvate dehydrogenase in its active non-phosphorylated form. The sensitivity to Ca2+ closely matched that found to affect oxoglutarate oxidation, and Mg2+ and Na+ gave similar effects. 4. Studies of others have indicated that the distribution of Ca2+ across the inner membrane of heart mitochondria is determined by a Ca2+-transporting system which is composed of a separate uptake component (inhibited by Mg2+ and Ruthenium Red) and an efflux component (stimulated by Na+). The present studies are entirely consistent with this view. They also indicate that the intramitochondrial concentration of Ca2+ within heart cells is probably about 2--3 times that in the cytoplasm, and thus the regulation of these intramitochondrial enzymes by Ca2+ is of likely physiological significance. It is suggested that the Ca2+-transporting system in heart mitochondria may be primarily concerned with the regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ rather than cytoplasmic Ca2+; the possible role of Ca2+ as a mediator of the effects of hormones and neurotransmitters on mammalian mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is discussed.},

Ca2+ (about 30 micrometer) resulted in a decrease in the apparent Km for 2-oxoglutarate from 2.1 to 0.16 mM (at pH 7) without altering the maximal velocity. At 0.1 mM-oxoglutarate there was a 4--5-fold activation by Ca2+, with an apparent Km for Ca2+ of 1.2 micrometer. A similar activation was also observed with Sr2+ (Km 15.1 micrometer), but not wised markedly from pH 7.4 TO 6.6. The effects of Ca2+ remained evident over this pH range. 4. In the presence of Mg2+, ATP resulted in a marked increase in the apparent Km for oxoglutarate, whereas ADP greatly decreased thisp arameter. The concentrations of adenine nucleotide required for half-maximal effects were about 10 micrometer in each case. 5. The effects of the adenine nucleotides and Ca2+ on the apparent Km for oxoglutarate appeared to be essentially independent of each other, reversible, and demonstrable in the presence of end product inhibition by NADH and obtained. 6. Effects similar to those described above were also observed on the activity of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase from rat heart and brown adipose tissue. 7. We discuss the mechanisms controlling this enzyme's activity and compare these regulatory features with those of NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase and the pyruvate dehydrogenase system, which are also sensitive to Ca2+ and adenine nucleotides.},

@article{Joost:2001kx,
	Abstract = {During the last 2 years, several novel genes that encode glucose transporter-like proteins have been identified and characterized. Because of their sequence similarity with GLUT1, these genes appear to belong to the family of solute carriers 2A (SLC2A, protein symbol GLUT). Sequence comparisons of all 13 family members allow the definition of characteristic sugar/polyol transporter signatures: (1) the presence of 12 membrane-spanning helices, (2) seven conserved glycine residues in the helices, (3) several basic and acidic residues at the intracellular surface of the proteins, (4) two conserved tryptophan residues, and (5) two conserved tyrosine residues. On the basis of sequence similarities and characteristic elements, the extended GLUT family can be divided into three subfamilies, namely class I (the previously known glucose transporters GLUT1-4), class II (the previously known fructose transporter GLUT5, the GLUT7, GLUT9 and GLUT11), and class III (GLUT6, 8, 10, 12, and the myo-inositol transporter HMIT1). Functional characteristics have been reported for some of the novel GLUTs. Like GLUT1-4, they exhibit a tissue/cell-specific expression (GLUT6, leukocytes, brain; GLUT8, testis, blastocysts, brain, muscle, adipocytes; GLUT9, liver, kidney; GLUT10, liver, pancreas; GLUT11, heart, skeletal muscle). GLUT6 and GLUT8 appear to be regulated by sub-cellular redistribution, because they are targeted to intra-cellular compartments by dileucine motifs in a dynamin dependent manner. Sugar transport has been reported for GLUT6, 8, and 11; HMIT1 has been shown to be a H+/myo-inositol co-transporter. Thus, the members of the extended GLUT family exhibit a surprisingly diverse substrate specificity, and the definition of sequence elements determining this substrate specificity will require a full functional characterization of all members.},

	Abstract = {AIMS: Cardiac myocytes depend on a delicate balance of glucose and free fatty acids as energy sources, a balance that is disrupted in pathological states such as diabetic cardiomyopathy and myocardial ischaemia. There are two families of cellular glucose transporters: the facilitated-diffusion glucose transporters (GLUT); and the sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLT). It has long been thought that only the GLUT isoforms, GLUT1 and GLUT4, are responsible for cardiac myocyte glucose uptake. However, we discovered that one SGLT isoform, SGLT1, is also an important glucose transporter in heart. In this study, we aimed to determine the human and murine cardiac expression pattern of SGLT1 in health and disease and to determine its regulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: SGLT1 was largely localized to the cardiac myocyte sarcolemma. Changes in SGLT1 expression were observed in disease states in both humans and mouse models. SGLT1 expression was upregulated two- to three-fold in type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial ischaemia (P < 0.05). In humans with severe heart failure, functional improvement following implantation of left ventricular assist devices led to a two-fold increase in SGLT1 mRNA (P < 0.05). Acute administration of leptin to wildtype mice increased cardiac SGLT1 expression approximately seven-fold (P < 0.05). Insulin- and leptin-stimulated cardiac glucose uptake was significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited by phlorizin, a specific SGLT1 inhibitor. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cardiac SGLT1 expression and/or function are regulated by insulin and leptin, and are perturbed in disease. This is the first study to examine the regulation of cardiac SGLT1 expression by insulin and leptin and to determine changes in SGLT1 expression in cardiac disease.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this work was to examine the consequences of the heterologous expression of a spinach ( Spinacia oleracea L.) sucrose transporter ( SoSUT1) in potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.). Many studies have indicated that reduction of the expression of this class of sucrose transporter has deleterious effects on plant growth and development; however, until now the possibility of improving plant performance by enhancing the expression of this sucrose transporter has not been reported. With this intention we constructed a chimeric construct in which SoSUT1 was cloned in-frame with the myc epitope. We confirmed that this construct, SoSUT1m, was able to mediate sucrose transport by expression in the yeast strain SUSY7. SoSUT1m was expressed in wild-type potato in the sense orientation under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter to evaluate the effect of an increased constitutive expression of a class-I sucrose transporter. We confirmed that these plants displayed expression of SoSUT1 at both the transcript and protein level and that microsomal fragments isolated from selected lines had an increased sucrose uptake capacity. Analysis of metabolism of these lines indicated that the leaves were characterised by a reduced sucrose level yet exhibited little change in photosynthetic rate. Furthermore, despite the observed increase in sugar (and reduction in amino acid) levels within the tubers, there was little change in either starch content or tuber yield in the transformants. In summary, the genetic manipulation described in this paper resulted in a shift in carbon partitioning in both leaves and tubers and an increased sucrose uptake rate in plasma-membrane vesicles isolated from these lines, but had little impact on tuber metabolism or morphology.},

MCA complements current studies of genomics and proteomics, providing a link between biochemistry and functional genomics that relates the expression of genes and gene products to cellular biochemical and physiological events. Thus, it is an important tool for the study of genotype-phenotype correlations. It allows genes to be ranked according to their importance in controlling and regulating cellular metabolic networks.

	Abstract = {Systems biology is based on the understanding that the behaviour of the whole is greater than would be expected from the sum of its parts. Thus the ultimate goal of systems biology is to predict the behaviour of the whole system on the basis of the list of components involved. Recent advances in '-omics' technologies and the development of new computational techniques and algorithms have greatly contributed to progress in this field of biology. Among the main '-omics' technologies, metabolomics is expected to play a significant role in bridging the phenotype-genotype gap, since it amplifies changes in the proteome and provides a better representation of the phenotype of an organism than other methods. However, knowledge of the complete set of metabolites is not enough to predict the phenotype, especially for higher cells in which the distinct metabolic processes involved in their production and degradation are finely regulated and interconnected. In these cases, quantitative knowledge of intracellular fluxes is required for a comprehensive characterization of metabolic networks and their functional operation. These intracellular fluxes cannot be detected directly, but can be estimated through interpretation of stable isotope patterns in metabolites. Moreover, analysis of these fluxes by means of metabolic control theories offers a potentially unifying, holistic paradigm to explain the regulation of cell metabolism. In this chapter, we provide an overview of metabolomics and fluxomics, highlighting stable isotope strategies for fluxome characterization. We also discuss some of the tools used to quantitatively analyse the control exerted by components of the network over both the metabolome and the fluxome. Finally, we outline the role and future of metabolomics and fluxomics in drug discovery.},

	Abstract = {Systems Biology is the science that aims to understand how biological function absent from macromolecules in isolation, arises when they are components of their system. Dedicated to the memory of Reinhart Heinrich, this paper discusses the origin and evolution of the new part of systems biology that relates to metabolic and signal-transduction pathways and extends mathematical biology so as to address postgenomic experimental reality. Various approaches to modeling the dynamics generated by metabolic and signal-transduction pathways are compared. The silicon cell approach aims to describe the intracellular network of interest precisely, by numerically integrating the precise rate equations that characterize the ways macromolecules' interact with each other. The non-equilibrium thermodynamic or 'lin-log' approach approximates the enzyme rate equations in terms of linear functions of the logarithms of the concentrations. Biochemical Systems Analysis approximates in terms of power laws. Importantly all these approaches link system behavior to molecular interaction properties. The latter two do this less precisely but enable analytical solutions. By limiting the questions asked, to optimal flux patterns, or to control of fluxes and concentrations around the (patho)physiological state, Flux Balance Analysis and Metabolic/Hierarchical Control Analysis again enable analytical solutions. Both the silicon cell approach and Metabolic/Hierarchical Control Analysis are able to highlight where and how system function derives from molecular interactions. The latter approach has also discovered a set of fundamental principles underlying the control of biological systems. The new law that relates concentration control to control by time is illustrated for an important signal transduction pathway, i.e. nuclear hormone receptor signaling such as relevant to bone formation. It is envisaged that there is much more Mathematical Biology to be discovered in the area between molecules and Life.},

	Abstract = {The role of the hydrolysis products of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), in the control of myocardial respiration was evaluated in vivo using 31P NMR. These studies were conducted to evaluate whether increases in the ATP hydrolysis products can be detected through the cardiac cycle or during increases in cardiac work. 31P NMR data acquisitions gated to various portions of the cardiac cycle (50 msec time resolution) revealed that cytosolic ATP, ADP and Pi did not change over the course of the cardiac cycle. These metabolites were also monitored during steady-state increases in cardiac work in conjunction with measurements of coronary blood flow and oxygen consumption. No changes were observed during 2 to 3 fold increases in myocardial oxygen consumption induced by various methods. These results demonstrate that the cytosolic ATP, ADP, and Pi concentrations remain relatively constant throughout the cardiac cycle and during physiological increases in cardiac work and oxygen consumption. Furthermore, it is shown that ADP and Pi cannot be solely responsible for the regulation of cardiac respiration in vivo based on the in vitro Km values of these compounds for oxidative phosphorylation. It is concluded that other mechanisms, working in concert with the simple kinetic feedback of ATP hydrolysis products, must be present in the cytosol to provide control of myocardial respiration in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Cyclical changes in energy-related metabolites were observed in glucose-perfused but not pyruvate-perfused isolated working rat hearts. A chronological study of various phases of the cardiac cycle indicated maximum changes in metabolites occurred at half time to peak pressure (dF/dtmax). The high-energy phosphates ATP and phosphocreatine, as well as the glycolytic metabolites, glucose 6-phosphate and pyruvate, reached minimum values immediately prior to peak systole and maximum values during late diastole. The products of high-energy phosphate hydrolysis, ADP, inorganic phosphate, and creatine, as well as the regulator, adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, showed the phase alternate. It was necessary to study cyclical changes in a maximally stressed glucose-perfused heart because the cyclical changes were small and appeared to be the result of rate-limiting steps in glycolysis and the slow transport of NADH into the mitochondria. For stressing the heart, thereby increasing ATP utilization and augmenting cyclical changes, the afterload chamber was set at 110 mmHg, and the perfusate contained high concentrations of calcium (3.5 mM, free) and isoproterenol (5 X 10(-9) M). When correction was made for binding and compartmentation of metabolites, data indicated that the free energy of ATP hydrolysis was preserved during the contraction process by a continuous binding and recycling of ADP.},

These were perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit solution containing pyruvate. CP decreased at both early- and end-systole whereas Pi and ADP increased in these phases. Both ATP and intracellular pH decreased significantly at end-systole. The indices of the affinity for ATP hydrolysis [Pi]/[CP] and [ADP] [Pu]/[APT] increased at early-systole, indicating that a large consumption of high-energy phosphates occurred at early-systole. Furthermore, the cyclical changes in ATP, CP and Pi were augmented in the high contractile state induced by infusion of isoproterenol. These results strongly suggest that the cyclical changes in the energy-related metabolites during a cardiac cycle are caused mainly by an augmentation of energy consumption during early-systole and an insufficient energy supply during systole, probably due to the slow intracellular transport of CP.},

It also allows a qualitative analysis of the myocardial energy level during the cycle under the condition of the same or different cardiac workload (rate pressure product, HR x LVP). This method was used to observe cyclical changes in the concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), P(i), and in pH during the cardiac cycle, and confirmed that the levels of ATP and PCr showed reversible decreases, and P(i) showed an antiphasic increase at the peak systole. On the other hand, no significant changes in pH were noted during the cardiac cycle.

	Abstract = {The myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO(2)) to left ventricular pressure-volume area (PVA) relationship is assumed unaltered by substrates, despite varying phosphate-to-oxygen ratios and possible excess MVO(2) associated with fatty acid consumption. The validity of this assumption was tested in vivo. Left ventricular volumes and pressures were assessed with a combined conductance-pressure catheter in eight anesthetized pigs. MVO(2) was calculated from coronary flow and arterial-coronary sinus O(2) differences. Metabolism was altered by glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) or Intralipid-heparin (IH) infusions in random order and monitored with [(14)C]glucose and [(3)H]oleate tracers. Profound shifts in glucose and fatty acid oxidation were observed. Contractility, coronary flow, and slope of the MVO(2)-PVA relationship were unchanged during GIK and IH infusions. MVO(2) at zero PVA (unloaded MVO(2)) was 0.16 +/- 0.13 J x beat(-1) x 100 g(-1) higher during IH compared with GIK infusion (P = 0.001), a 48\% increase.

Under control conditions, cyclical changes ("cycling") of ATP (11+/-3\%*, *P < 0.05) and phosphocreatine (9+/-2\%*) were detected, inorganic phosphate cycling did not reach statistical significance. At high [Ca2+] perfusion, cycling of phosphocreatine (9+/-5\%*) was not accentuated, cycling of ATP and inorganic phosphate did not reach significance. During acute hypoxia, cycling of ATP (10+/-4\%*) and inorganic phosphate (11+/-4\%*) occurred, but cyclical changes of phosphocreatine were not significant. In chronically infarcted hearts, the extent of cyclical changes of ATP, phosphocreatine, and inorganic phosphate was not accentuated.

	Abstract = {The process of skeletal muscle aging is characterized by a progressive loss of muscle mass and functionality. The underlying mechanisms are highly complex and remain unclear. This study was designed to further investigate the consequences of aging on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in rat gastrocnemius muscle, by comparing young (6 months) and aged (21 months) rats. Maximal oxidative phosphorylation capacity was clearly reduced in older rats, while mitochondrial efficiency was unaffected. Inner membrane properties were unaffected in aged rats since proton leak kinetics were identical to young rats. Application of top-down control analysis revealed a dysfunction of the phosphorylation module in older rats, responsible for a dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation under low activities close to in vivo ATP turnover. This dysregulation is responsible for an impaired mitochondrial response toward changes in cellular ATP demand, leading to a decreased membrane potential which may in turn affect ROS production and ion homeostasis. Based on our data, we propose that modification of ANT properties with aging could partly explain these mitochondrial dysfunctions.},

Conversely, LV mitochondrial O(2) consumption was attenuated (P < 0.05 vs. control) and proton leak significantly increased. In parallel, expression of mitochondrial regulators was upregulated in the hypertrophied RV but not the LV.

	Abstract = {We hypothesized the coordinate induction of mitochondrial regulatory genes in the hypertrophied right ventricle to sustain mitochondrial respiratory capacity and contractile function in response to increased load. Wistar rats were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (11\% O(2)) or normoxia for 2 wk. Cardiac contractile and mitochondrial respiratory function were separately assessed for the right and left ventricles. Transcript levels of several mitochondrial regulators were measured. A robust hypertrophic response was observed in the right (but not left) ventricle in response to hypobaric hypoxia. Mitochondrial O(2) consumption was increased in the right ventricle, while proton leak was reduced vs. normoxic controls. Citrate synthase activity and mitochondrial DNA content were significantly increased in the hypertrophied right ventricle, suggesting higher mitochondrial number. Transcript levels of nuclear respiratory factor-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-coactivator-1alpha, cytochrome oxidase (COX) subunit II, and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) were coordinately induced in the hypertrophied right ventricle following hypoxia. UCP3 transcript levels were significantly reduced in the hypertrophied right ventricle vs. normoxic controls. Exposure to chronic hypobaric hypoxia had no significant effects on left ventricular mitochondrial respiration or contractile function. However, COXIV and UCP2 gene expression were increased in the left ventricle in response to chronic hypobaric hypoxia. In summary, we found coordinate induction of several genes regulating mitochondrial function and higher mitochondrial number in a model of physiological right ventricular hypertrophy, linking the efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and respiratory function to sustained contractile function in response to the increased load.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac energy metabolism is impaired, as indicated by a reduction of the myocardial phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio, measured noninvasively by 31P-MR spectroscopy. The purpose of this study was to test whether the phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio also offers prognostic information in terms of mortality prediction as well as how this index compares with well-known mortality predictors such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were followed up for 928+/-85 days (2.5 years). At study entry, LVEF and NYHA class were determined, and the cardiac phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio was measured by localized 31P-MR spectroscopy of the anterior myocardium. During the study period, total mortality was 26\%. Patients were divided into two groups, one with a normal phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio (>1.60; mean+/-SE, 1.98+/-0.07; n=19; healthy volunteers: 1.94+/-0.11, n=30) and one with a reduced phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio (<1.60; 1.30+/-0.05; n=20). At re-evaluation (mean, 2.5 years), 8 of 20 patients with reduced phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratios had died, all of cardiovascular causes (total and cardiovascular mortality, 40\%). Of the 19 patients with normal phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratios, 2 had died (total mortality, 11\%), one of cardiovascular causes (cardiovascular mortality, 5\%). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly reduced total (P=.036) and cardiovascular (P=.016) mortality for patients with normal versus patients with low phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratios. A Cox model for multivariate analysis showed that the phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio and NYHA class offered significant independent prognostic information on cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The myocardial phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio, measured noninvasively with 31P-MR spectroscopy, is a predictor of both total and cardiovascular mortality in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.},

The results show that the increased rate of oxygen consumption at high protonmotive force is explained entirely by the dependence on protonmotive force of the passive proton leak conductance of the mitochondrial inner membrane. There is no measurable contribution from redox-slip reactions in the proton pumps caused by high protonmotive force. Neither is there any contribution from increased proton conductance of the membrane or increased redox slip in the respiratory chain caused by high turnover rates of the complexes.},

@article{Meyer:1984uq,
	Abstract = {The diffusive mobility of solutes chemically connected by reversible reactions in cells is analyzed as a problem of facilitated diffusion. By this term we mean that the diffusive flux of any substance, X, which is in one metabolic pathway, is effectively increased when it participates in a second and equilibrium reaction with another substance Y because the total flux of X in the pathway is the sum of the fluxes of X and Y. This notion is generalized and is seen to include the familiar enhanced intracellular diffusion of oxygen by oxymyoglobin. In this framework the function of creatine kinase (CK) is seen to have two aspects: 1) phosphocreatine (PCr) via the CK reaction buffers the cellular ATP and ADP concentrations and 2) transport of high-energy phosphates is predominantly in the chemical form of PCr. This predominance of PCr is a consequence of the maintained ATP, ADP, and total creatine levels and of the apparent equilibrium constant of the reaction. Thus experimental results demonstrating the transport aspects of the CK reaction emphasize only one feature of a more general notion of facilitated diffusion by near-equilibrium metabolic reactions and do not per se establish the existence of any physical or functional compartmentation of ATP, ADP, PCr, or creatine. PCr can be a large source for increasing inorganic phosphate levels during contractile activity, possibly as a metabolic regulator. Neither the transport nor buffer aspects can be quantitatively important in cells with small distances between ATP-utilizing and ATP-generating sites, such as is the case with cardiac myofibrils and mitochondria.},

	Abstract = {The heart is capable of balancing the rate of mitochondrial ATP production with utilization continuously over a wide range of activity. This results in a constant phosphorylation potential despite a large change in metabolite turnover. The molecular mechanisms responsible for generating this energy homeostasis are poorly understood. The best candidate for a cytosolic signaling molecule reflecting ATP hydrolysis is Ca(2+). Since Ca(2+) initiates and powers muscle contraction as well as serves as the primary substrate for SERCA, Ca(2+) is an ideal feed-forward signal for priming ATP production. With the sarcoplasmic reticulum to cytosolic Ca(2+) gradient near equilibrium with the free energy of ATP, cytosolic Ca(2+) release is exquisitely sensitive to the cellular energy state providing a feedback signal. Thus, Ca(2+) can serve as a feed-forward and feedback regulator of ATP production. Consistent with this notion is the correlation of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) with work in numerous preparations as well as the localization of mitochondria near Ca(2+) release sites. How cytosolic Ca(2+) signaling might regulate oxidative phosphorylation is a focus of this review. The relevant Ca(2+) sensitive sites include several dehydrogenases and substrate transporters together with a post-translational modification of F1-FO-ATPase and cytochrome oxidase. Thus, Ca(2+) apparently activates both the generation of the mitochondrial membrane potential as well as utilization to produce ATP. This balanced activation extends the energy homeostasis observed in the cytosol into the mitochondria matrix in the never resting heart.},

@article{Griffiths:2009kx,
	Abstract = {Mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport was initially considered important only in buffering of cytosolic Ca(2+) by acting as a "sink" under conditions of Ca(2+) overload. The main regulator of ATP production was considered to be the relative concentrations of high energy phosphates. However, work by Denton and McCormack in the 1970s and 1980s showed that free intramitochondrial Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](m)) activated dehydrogenase enzymes in mitochondria, leading to increased NADH and hence ATP production. This leads them to propose a scheme, subsequently termed a "parallel activation model" whereby increases in energy demand, such as hormonal stimulation or increased workload in muscle, produced an increase in cytosolic [Ca(2+)] that was relayed by the mitochondrial Ca(2+) transporters into the matrix to give an increase in [Ca(2+)](m). This then stimulated energy production to meet the increased energy demand. With the development of methods for measuring [Ca(2+)](m) in living cells that proved [Ca(2+)](m) changed over a dynamic physiological range rather than simply soaking up excess cytosolic [Ca(2+)], this model has now gained widespread acceptance. However, work by ourselves and others using targeted probes to measure changes in both [Ca(2+)] and [ATP] in different cell compartments has revealed variations in the interrelationships between these two in different tissues, suggesting that metabolic regulation by Ca(2+) is finely tuned to the demands and function of the individual organ.},

	Abstract = {We present an integrated thermokinetic model describing control of cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics. The model describes the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial Ca(2+) handling. The kinetic component of the model includes effectors of the TCA cycle enzymes regulating production of NADH and FADH(2), which in turn are used by the electron transport chain to establish a proton motive force (Delta mu(H)), driving the F(1)F(0)-ATPase. In addition, mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+), determined by Ca(2+) uniporter and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger activities, regulates activity of the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The model is described by twelve ordinary differential equations for the time rate of change of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)), and matrix concentrations of Ca(2+), NADH, ADP, and TCA cycle intermediates. The model is used to predict the response of mitochondria to changes in substrate delivery, metabolic inhibition, the rate of adenine nucleotide exchange, and Ca(2+). The model is able to reproduce, qualitatively and semiquantitatively, experimental data concerning mitochondrial bioenergetics, Ca(2+) dynamics, and respiratory control. Significant increases in oxygen consumption (V(O(2))), proton efflux, NADH, and ATP synthesis, in response to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+), are obtained when the Ca(2+)-sensitive dehydrogenases are the main rate-controlling steps of respiratory flux. These responses diminished when control is shifted downstream (e.g., the respiratory chain or adenine nucleotide translocator). The time-dependent behavior of the model, under conditions simulating an increase in workload, closely reproduces experimentally observed mitochondrial NADH dynamics in heart trabeculae subjected to changes in pacing frequency. The steady-state and time-dependent behavior of the model support the hypothesis that mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+) plays an important role in matching energy supply with demand in cardiac myocytes.},

	Abstract = {kappa-Opioid receptor (kappa-OR) stimulation with U50,488H, a selective kappa-OR agonist, or activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC, decreased the electrically induced intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) transient and increased the intracellular pH (pH(i)) in single ventricular myocytes of rats subjected to 10\% oxygen for 4 wk. The effects of U50,488H were abolished by nor-binaltorphimine, a selective kappa-OR antagonist, and calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of PKC, while the effects of PMA were abolished by calphostin C and ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), a potent Na(+)/H(+) exchange blocker. In both right hypertrophied and left nonhypertrophied ventricles of chronically hypoxic rats, the effects of U50,488H or PMA on [Ca(2+)](i) transient and pH(i) were significantly attenuated and completely abolished, respectively. Results are first evidence that the [Ca(2+)](i) and pH(i) responses to kappa-OR stimulation are attenuated in the chronically hypoxic rat heart, which may be due to reduced responses to PKC activation. Responses to all treatments were the same for right and left ventricles, indicating that the functional impairment is independent of hypertrophy. kappa-OR mRNA expression was the same in right and left ventricles of both normoxic and hypoxic rats, indicating no regional specificity.},

	Abstract = {Cardiac-specific transgenesis in the mouse is widely used to study the basic biology and chemistry of the heart and to model human cardiovascular disease. A fundamental difference between mouse and human hearts is the background motor protein: mouse hearts contain predominantly the alphaalpha-myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isozyme while human hearts contain predominantly the betabeta-MyHC isozyme. Although the intrinsic differences in mechanical and enzymatic properties of the alphaalpha- and betabeta-MyHC molecules are well known, the consequences of isozyme shifts on energetics of the intact beating heart remain unknown. Therefore, we compared the free energy of ATP hydrolysis (|DeltaG( approximately ATP)|) determined by (31)P-NMR spectroscopy in isolated perfused littermate mouse hearts containing the same amount of myosin comprised of either >95\% alphaalpha-MyHC or approximately 83\% betabeta-MyHC. |DeltaG( approximately ATP)| was approximately 2 kJ mol(-1) higher in the betabeta-MyHC hearts at all workloads. Furthermore, upon inotropic challenge, hearts containing predominantly betabeta-MyHC hearts increased developed pressure more than alphaalpha-MyHC hearts whereas heart rate increased more in alphaalpha-MyHC hearts. Thus, hearts containing predominantly the betabeta-MyHC isozyme are more energy efficient than alphaalpha-MyHC hearts. We suggest that these fundamental differences in the motor protein energy efficiency at the whole heart level should be considered when interpreting results using mouse-based cardiovascular modeling of normal and diseased human hearts.},

	Abstract = {The present study determined Ca2+ handling in the hearts of rats subjected to chronic hypoxia (CH). Spectrofluorometry was used to measure intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and its responses to electrical stimulation, caffeine, and isoproterenol in myocytes from the right ventricle of rats breathing 10\% oxygen for 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56 days and age-matched controls. The protein expression of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and its ryanodine receptor (RyR) were measured. The uptake of 45Ca2+ by SERCA, release by RyR, and extrusion by Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NCX) were determined. It was found that Ca2+ homeostasis and Ca2+ responses to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation reached a new equilibrium after 4 wk of CH. Ca2+ content in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was reduced, but cytosolic Ca2+ remained unchanged after CH. Expression of SERCA and its Ca2+ uptake, Ca2+ release via RyR, and NCX activity were suppressed by CH. The results indicate impaired Ca2+ handling, which may be responsible for the attenuated Ca2+ responses to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in CH.},

@article{Smith:2006bs,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The progression of pressure-overload left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to chronic heart failure (CHF) may involve a relative deficit in energy supply and/or delivery. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured myocardial creatine kinase (CK) metabolite concentrations and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis through CK, the primary energy reserve of the heart, to test the hypothesis that ATP flux through CK is impaired in patients with LVH and CHF. Myocardial ATP levels were normal, but creatine phosphate levels were 35\% lower in LVH patients (n = 10) than in normal subjects (n = 14, P < 0.006). Left ventricular mass and CK metabolite levels in LVH were not different from those in patients with LVH and heart failure (LVH+CHF, n = 10); however, the myocardial CK pseudo first-order rate constant was normal in LVH (0.36 +/- 0.04 s(-1) in LVH versus 0.32 +/- 0.06 s(-1) in normal subjects) but halved in LVH+CHF (0.17 +/- 0.06 s(-1), P < 0.001). The net ATP flux through CK was significantly reduced by 30\% in LVH (2.2 +/- 0.7 micromol x g(-1) x s(-1), P = 0.011) and by a dramatic 65\% in LVH+CHF (1.1 +/- 0.4 micromol x g(-1) x s(-1), P < 0.001) compared with normal subjects (3.1 +/- 0.8 micromol x g(-1) x s(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: These first observations in human LVH demonstrate that it is not the relative or absolute CK metabolite pool sizes but rather the kinetics of ATP turnover through CK that distinguish failing from nonfailing hypertrophic hearts. Moreover, the deficit in ATP kinetics is similar in systolic and nonsystolic heart failure and is not related to the severity of hypertrophy but to the presence of CHF. Because CK temporally buffers ATP, these observations support the hypothesis that a deficit in myofibrillar energy delivery contributes to CHF pathophysiology in human LVH.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The creatine kinase (CK) reaction is important for rapid resynthesis of ATP when the heart increases its work. Studies defining the CK system in human failing and nonfailing myocardium are limited and in conflict. To resolve this conflict, we measured the activities of CK and its isoenzymes and the contents of creatine and CK-B in homogenates of human myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Myocardium was sampled from 23 subjects who underwent heart transplant, 36 subjects maintained in an intensive care unit before heart harvesting, 13 accident victims, and 2 patients undergoing heart surgery. Since the characteristics of myocardium of potential organ donors differed from those of myocardium of accident victims, data are presented for three groups: failing, donor, and control. CK activity was 7.7 +/- 1.9 and 6.0 +/- 1.4 IU/mg protein in left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles of failing, 9.4 +/- 2.5 and 10.7 +/- 2 IU/mg protein in LV and RV of donor, and 11.6 +/- 2.4 IU/mg protein in LV of control hearts. CK-MM and the mitochondrial isoenzyme activities were lower in failing and donor LV, and CK-MB activity and CK-B content were higher in failing and donor hearts. Creatine contents were 64 +/- 25 and 56 +/- 18.6 nmol/mg protein in LV and RV of failing, 96 +/- 30 and 110 +/- 24 nmol/mg protein in LV and RV of donor, and 131 +/- 28 nmol/mg protein in LV of control hearts. CONCLUSIONS: In failing and nonfailing donor human myocardium, there is a combined decrease of CK activity and creatine that may impair the ability to deliver ATP to energy-consuming systems.},

	Abstract = {The effects of chronic hypobaric hypoxia (CHH, 28 days, simulated altitude 5,500 m) on the cardiac expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) and creatine kinase (CK) was studied in rat left (LV) and right (RV) ventricle. To separate the effects of hypoxia from its associated perturbations, anorexia and pulmonary hypertension (resulting in RV hypertrophy), CHH animals were compared with normoxic controls (C) and with rats restricted in food supply (pair fed, PF). In RV, the increased proportion of beta-MHC in CHH (20 +/- 3\%) vs. C (7 +/- 2\%, P < 0.01) and vs. PF (12 +/- 2\%, P < 0.05) rats was mainly attributed to hypertension. In contrast, the higher beta-MHC of CHH (23 +/- 2\%) vs. C (13 +/- 2\%, P < 0.05) in LV was mainly ascribed to anorexia (PF = 21 +/- 3\%, not significant). A major contribution of anorexia was also evidenced in the isozymic profile of CK; anorexia accounted for a 25\% decrease in mito-CK specific activity in LV, whereas hypertension partly accounted for the threefold increase in BB-CK in RV. CHH specifically induced a twofold rise in LV BB-CK. This suggests that both the expression of slow myosin, improving the economy of contraction, and the changes in CK isozymic profile could provide a biochemical basis for the CHH resistance to ischemia.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to use a model of chronic anaemia in the rat, in which there is an increase in cardiac mitochondrial creatine kinase activity (mito-CK) per mitochondrion, to test the hypothesis that creatine stimulated respiration in saponin skinned fibres is correlated with mito-CK activity. In order to discuss the altered regulation of mitochondrial respiratory rate in the context of other metabolic alterations, steady state metabolite concentrations and maximum extracted activities of regulatory enzymes in glycolysis were also investigated. METHODS: Weanling male Wistar Albino rats were randomly distributed into two experimental groups. One group received a powdered diet deficient in iron (5-7 mg iron.kg-1) while the second group was placed on a standard laboratory chow diet (109 mg iron.kg-1) for 4-8 weeks. RESULTS: Total cardiac creatine kinase activity was unchanged in anaemic rats; however, a 25\% increase in nascent or functional mito-CK activity per mitochondrion was detected [0.969(SEM 0.005), control group and 1.203(0.040), anaemic group, p < 0.001]. The sensitivity of creatine (40 mM creatine, VCr) and ADP (0.1 mM ADP, V0.1) stimulated respiration, as a percentage of maximum respiratory rate (2.0 mM ADP, V2.0), was increased by 48\% and 52\% respectively in the anaemic skinned cardiac fibres. An increase in basal respiration with glutamate and malate as substrates was detected in the anaemic group compared to the control group, at 6.77(0.74) v 4.58(0.35) ng O.min-1 x mg-1 dry weight (p < 0.025). Cytosolic ATP was decreased in isolated perfused hearts from anaemic animals, at 35.18(3.11) mumol.g-1 dry weight in control hearts versus 23.66(1.42) in anaemic hearts (p < 0.01). A significant increase in myocardial glycolytic capacity was detected in anaemic cardiac tissue, as evidenced by a 20\% increase in phosphofructokinase activity (p < 0.01). Phosphorylase activity was unaltered in anaemic hearts, indicating that the increased glucose requirement originated from exogenous sources. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was increased by 30\% in anaemic hearts (p < 0.001). The LDH isozyme profile was shifted in favour of lactate and NAD+ production, thus supporting anaerobic glycolysis. CONCLUSIONS: In support of the phosphocreatine circuit model, the increased mito-CK per mitochondrion in the anaemic skinned fibre preparation was associated with an increase in creatine stimulated respiration. In addition, the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiratory rate to ADP and the maximum glycolytic capacity were increased in anaemic fibres. Although the net effect of these changes in metabolic capacity and regulation on in vivo high energy phosphate flux is unknown, it is likely that they are adaptive alterations that compensate for the lower steady state cytosolic nucleotide concentration.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated the effect of chronic exposure of rats to an hypoxic environment (10\% O2; 3 weeks), on the first step of the intracellular energy transfer process in the myocardium, i.e. the transfer at mitochondrial level of high energy bonds from ATP to creatine. In the left ventricles from rats adapted to normobaric hypoxia, we observed, using the permeabilized fiber technique, that the stimulatory effect of creatine on the mitochondrial respiration in presence of a low ADP concentration (0.1 mM) was attenuated when compared to control. Furthermore, the creatine-induced decrease of the apparent K(m) for ADP of the mitochondrial respiration, which is observed in control, was significantly reduced. Both the basal and maximal respiratory rates of the fibers were unchanged by the hypoxic exposure of the rats. A significant decrease of the total creatine kinase activity from 755 to 630 IU/g wet weight (for control and hypoxic rats, respectively) was detected and was accompanied by a 25\% decrease in mitochondrial isoform activity (mitoCK) and in the mitoCK/citrate synthase ratio. In the right ventricles, identical alterations in the effect of creatine on apparent K(m) for ADP were observed while we did not detect any changes in CK activity. The decrease in mitoCK activity and the fall in the reactivity of respiration to creatine could be interpreted as a mechanism for downregulating oxygen demand during chronic hypoxia. The consequences of such alterations on energy metabolism of cardiomyocytes under conditions of reduced oxygen supply are discussed.},

When compared with the behaviour of control hearts, the inotropic response to Ca2+ and isoprenaline was larger in the hearts from hypoxic rats, while the oxygen consumption was similar. During administration of isoprenaline, a decrease in the myocardial contents of high energy phosphates (ATP and PCr) and an accumulation of Pi was observed in both groups. After action of isoprenaline, the hearts from hypoxic animals showed significant overshoot of PCr, that was not seen in hearts from normoxic rats. The mechanisms of these alterations are analysed and the phosphocreatine overshoot, as well as the increased rate pressure product to oxygen consumption ratio, are assumed to indicate more efficient energy conversion in the heart from animals adapted to chronic hypoxia.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: When the myocardium is subjected to a chronic overload, it enlarges and a major restructuring of all organelles and cellular functions occurs. The changes occurring at the level of the contractile apparatus are well documented; less is known about the alterations in the energy status of the hypertrophied cardiomyocyte. The purpose of this paper is firstly to provide a brief review of the data published on this topic and secondly to analyse previously published data drawn from studies devoted to the evaluation of the capacity of the ATP-producing processes to respond to an acute change in workload. METHODS: Several different chronic conditions were studied in rats: senescence, hypertension, chronic hypoxia, and administration of thyroid hormone. The pattern of the metabolic response of the heart to acute changes in workload was characterized by alterations in the concentrations of phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphate and ATP followed in isolated heart by 31P-NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: In most of the models studied the pattern of these changes was very similar to that observed in controls. The only exceptions concerned the hearts of young hypertensive rats and those of animals subjected to a cumulated overload (hypertension + thyroid hormone). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the regulation of energy metabolism was well preserved in spite of the extensive restructuring that occurs in rat hearts subjected to different chronic conditions which could affect the energy balance of the cardiomyocyte.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this work was to further define the value of cardiac 31P magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy for patients with coronary artery disease and dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood-corrected and T1-corrected 31P MR spectra of anteroseptal myocardium were obtained at rest using image-selected in vivo spectroscopy localization, a selected volume of 85 +/- 12 cm3, and a field strength of 1.5 T. Nineteen volunteers had a creatine phosphate (CP)/ATP ratio of 1.95 +/- 0.45 (mean +/- SD) and a PDE/ATP ratio of 1.06 +/- 0.53; in four patients with left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) stenosis, six patients with chronic anterior wall infarction, and four patients with chronic posterior wall infarction, CP/ATP and phosphodiester (PDE)/ATP ratios did not differ from those in volunteers. Twenty-five measurements of 19 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy yielded a CP/ATP of 1.78 +/- 0.51 and a PDE/ATP of 0.98 +/- 0.56 (p = NS versus volunteers). When these patients were grouped according to the severity of heart failure, however, CP/ATP was 1.94 +/- 0.43 in mild (p = NS versus volunteers) and 1.44 +/- 0.52 in severe DCM (p < 0.05), respectively. No correlation was found between CP/ATP and left ventricular ejection fraction or fractional shortening, but correlation of CP/ATP with the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was significant (r = 0.60, p < 0.005). Six patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were studied repeatedly before and after 12 +/- 6 weeks of drug treatment leading to clinical recompensation with improvement of the NYHA status by 0.8 +/- 0.3 classes. Concomitantly, CP/ATP increased from 1.51 +/- 0.32 to 2.15 +/- 0.27 (p < 0.01), whereas PDE/ATP did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolism at rest is normal in LAD stenosis and chronic myocardial infarction in the absence of heart failure. The CP/ATP ratio has low specificity for the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. However, CP/ATP correlated with the clinical severity of heart failure and may improve during clinical recompensation.},

@article{Wright:2003dq,
	Abstract = {Recently an oxygen-sensing/transducing mechanism has been identified as a family of O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes (PHD). In normoxia, PHD hydroxylates a specific proline residue that directs the degradation of constitutively synthesized hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha. During hypoxia, the cessation of hydroxylation of this proline results in less degradation and thus increases hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein levels. In this study we have examined the consequences of activating the PHD oxygen-sensing pathway in cultured neonatal myocytes using ethyl-3,4 dihydroxybenzoate and dimethyloxalylglycine, inhibitors that, similar to hypoxia, inhibit this family of O2-dependent PHD enzymes. Increased glucose uptake and enhanced glycolytic metabolism are classical cellular responses to hypoxia. Ethyl-3,4 dihydroxybenzoate treatment of cardiomyocyte cultures for 24 h increased [3H]deoxy-4-glucose uptake concurrent with an induction of GLUT1 protein. In addition, ethyl-3,4 dihydroxybenzoate, dimethyloxalylglycine, and hypoxia treatments were found to induce protein levels of nitricoxide synthase-2 and heme oxygenase-1, two important cardioregulatory proteins whose expression in response to hypoxic conditions is poorly understood. In conjunction with these changes in gene expression, activation of the PHD oxygen-sensing mechanism was found to preserve myocyte viability in the face of metabolic inhibition with cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose. These results point to a key role for the PHD pathway in the phenotypic changes that are observed in a hypoxic myocyte and may suggest a strategy to pharmacologically induce protection in heart.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the mechanism by which cardiac glucose utilization increases during hypoxia and increased work load, we studied the effect of 2 and 14 days of hypobaric hypoxia on the expression of two subtypes of the facilitative D-glucose transporter, the GLUT-4 or "insulin-regulatable" isoform and the GLUT-1 isoform thought to mediate basal transport. Rats lose weight when exposed to hypobaric hypoxia, so fasting controls were used in the 2-day studies and pair-fed controls in the 14-day experiments. Hypobaric hypoxia (PO2 69 mmHg) resulted in right ventricular (RV), but not left ventricular (LV), hypertrophy. RV and LV GLUT-1 mRNA levels increased 2- to 3-fold after 2 days and 1.5- to 2-fold after 14 days of hypobaric hypoxia compared with both fasted rats and normal controls. RV GLUT-1 protein increased approximately 3-fold and LV GLUT-1 protein increased 1.5-fold after 14 days of hypobaric hypoxia vs. both pair-fed and normal controls. RV GLUT-4 mRNA decreased to 26\% and RV GLUT-4 protein decreased to 54\% of normal control levels as a result of 2 days of hypobaric hypoxia. RV GLUT-4 mRNA decreased to 64\% of normal control levels with no change in RV GLUT-4 protein as a result of 2 days of fasting. We conclude that hypobaric hypoxia increases cardiac GLUT-1 expression at the pretranslational level in both ventricles. The greater increase in GLUT-1 protein on the right suggests an additive effect of pressure overload. GLUT-4 expression is reduced early in the development of RV hypertrophy.},

@article{Christian:1998qf,
	Abstract = {In this work, an attempt was made to identify the reasons of impaired long-chain fatty acid utilization that was previously described in volume-overloaded rat hearts. The most significant data are the following: (1) The slowing down of long-chain fatty acid oxidation in severely hypertrophied hearts cannot be related to a feedback inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I from an excessive stimulation of glucose oxidation since, because of decreased tissue levels of L-carnitine, glucose oxidation also declines in volume-overloaded hearts. (2) While, in control hearts, the estimated intracellular concentrations of free carnitine are in the range of the respective Km of mitochondrial CPT I, a kinetic limitation of this enzyme could occur in hypertrophied hearts due to a 40\% decrease in free carnitine. (3) The impaired palmitate oxidation persists upon the isolation of the mitochondria from these hearts even in presence of saturating concentrations of L-carnitine. In contrast, the rates of the conversion of both palmitoyl-CoA and palmitoylcarnitine into acetyl-CoA are unchanged. (4) The kinetic analyses of palmitoyl-CoA synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I reactions do not reveal any differences between the two mitochondrial populations studied. On the other hand, the conversion of palmitate into palmitoylcarnitine proves to be substrate inhibited already at physiological concentrations of exogenous palmitate. The data presented in this work demonstrate that, during the development of severe cardiac hypertrophy, a fragilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane may occur. The functional integrity of this membrane seems to be further deteriorated by increasing concentrations of free fatty acids which gives rise to an impaired cooperation between palmitoyl-CoA synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. In intact myocardium, the utilization of the in situ generated palmitoyl-CoA can be further slowed down by decreased intracellular concentrations of free carnitine.},

	Abstract = {The present study characterized metabolic changes in the heart associated with long-term exposure to hypoxia, a potent stimulus for pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. When anesthetized rats adapted to chronic hypoxia spontaneously respired room air, their mean right intraventricular peak systolic pressure (RVSP) was twice that in normal control animals with the same arterial PO2. RVSP was linearly related to right ventricular mass (r = 0.78). Oxidative capacity (O2 consumption) of homogenates of right and left ventricles from both groups of rats was measured with one of the following substrates: pyruvate, glutamate, acetate, and palmitoyl-L-carnitine. Oxidation of all substrates was significantly greater in the left than in the right ventricle in normal rats but not in hypoxia-adapted animals, where it was the same, within the experimental error. O2 consumption by the left ventricle was greater in control than in experimental rats, but right ventricular O2 consumption was similar in the two groups. Maximal reaction velocity of cytochrome-c oxidase was about the same in the two ventricles, and there were no significant differences between control and hypoxia-adapted animals. HPLC analyses showed significantly higher aspartate levels and aspartate-to glutamate concentration ratios in both ventricles of hypoxic rats than in corresponding tissues from controls, indicative of a decreased flux through the malate-aspartate shuttle under conditions of O2 limitation. Myocardial glutamine levels were lower in hypoxic rats, and glutamine-to-glutamate concentration ratios decreased, although primarily in the pressure-overloaded right ventricle. These findings indicate that normal energy metabolism in the left ventricle differs from that in the right and that the differences, particularly those of amino acid metabolism, are markedly influenced by chronic exposure to hypoxia.},

@article{Sack:2000ys,
	Abstract = {Fuel substrate utilization is highly regulated during cardiac development and with the onset of cardiac hypertrophy. Glucose and lactate are the predominant fuel substrates utilized during cardiac development. Postnatally, a switch occurs so that fatty acids become the chief energy substrate in the nonfed adult mammalian heart. A reversion back towards fetal energy metabolism occurs with the development of cardiac hypertrophy. To evaluate the role of this substrate preference switch in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, the molecular regulation directing these switches is being explored. Thus, we have begun by defining the temporal expression patterns of genes encoding key rate-controlling enzymes directing major fuel substrate metabolism during cardiac development, with pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and following antihypertensive therapy in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The genes encoding the fatty acid and adult enriched rate-controlling glycolytic enzymes are expressed at low levels in the fetal and neonatal rat heart. The genes encoding these enzymes are significantly and coordinately upregulated (> or = 70\%) in adult rat hearts compared to the fetal expression patterns. A reciprocal and coordinate downregulation (> or = 40\% reduction) of the fatty acid and adult enriched glycolytic enzyme encoding genes are observed with the induction of pressure-overload-induced hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared to Wistar-Furth normotensive control rats. Antihypertensive therapy with carvedilol, a vasodilating alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, attenuates this reversion of the metabolic gene expression pattern towards fetal levels compared to placebo-treated littermate controls. This coordinate developmental and hypertrophy-induced regulation of genes that encode enzymes controlling both fatty acid and glycolytic catabolic pathways in the heart implicates potential mutual/overlapping regulatory signaling proteins within their gene regulatory programs. These gene regulatory pathways need to be identified and modulated in order to characterize the functional role of fuel substrate metabolism in cardiac development and with the induction of cardiac hypertrophy.},

	Abstract = {The alterations in myocardial energy substrate metabolism that occur in heart failure, and the causes and consequences of these abnormalities, are poorly understood. There is evidence to suggest that impaired substrate metabolism contributes to contractile dysfunction and to the progressive left ventricular remodeling that are characteristic of the heart failure state. The general concept that has recently emerged is that myocardial substrate selection is relatively normal during the early stages of heart failure; however, in the advanced stages there is a downregulation in fatty acid oxidation, increased glycolysis and glucose oxidation, reduced respiratory chain activity, and an impaired reserve for mitochondrial oxidative flux. This review discusses 1) the metabolic changes that occur in chronic heart failure, with emphasis on the mechanisms that regulate the changes in the expression of metabolic genes and the function of metabolic pathways; 2) the consequences of these metabolic changes on cardiac function; 3) the role of changes in myocardial substrate metabolism on ventricular remodeling and disease progression; and 4) the therapeutic potential of acute and long-term manipulation of cardiac substrate metabolism in heart failure.},

The molecular mechanisms driving this 'metabolic remodelling' process and their significance for the development of cardiac failure are still open to discussion. Next to changes in mitochondrial function, the hypertrophied heart is characterized by a marked shift in substrate preference away from fatty acids towards glucose. It has been argued that the decline in fatty acid oxidation is not fully compensated for by a rise in glucose oxidation, thereby imposing an additional burden on overall ATP generating capacity. Several lines of evidence suggest that these metabolic adaptations are brought about, at least in part, by alterations in the rate of transcription of genes encoding for proteins involved in substrate transport and metabolism. Here, the principal metabolic changes are reviewed and the various molecular mechanisms that are likely to play a role are discussed. In addition, the potential significance of these changes for the aetiology of heart failure is evaluated.},

In cells from hypothyroid rats compared with littermate euthyroid controls, there were significant kinetic effects on non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption reactions and on mitochondrial proton leak but not on ATP turnover. Approximately 50\% of the decrease in cellular oxygen consumption of hypothyroid cells was accounted for by a decrease in mitochondrial proton leak rate and approximately 50\% by decreased non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Metabolic control analysis showed that the distribution of control over oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial potential in hepatocytes from hypothyroid animals was broadly similar to its distribution in euthyroid controls. In cells from hyperthyroid rats compared with littermate euthyroid controls, there were significant kinetic effects on mitochondrial proton leak and on the reactions involved in ATP synthesis and consumption but not on non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to study metabolic energy stores and lactate content in chronic reversibly and irreversibly dysfunctional myocardium. BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether metabolism is deranged in chronic reversibly and irreversibly dysfunctional myocardium in humans. Semiquantitative histological examinations have shown altered mitochondrial morphology and glycogen accumulation in dysfunctional regions. METHODS: We studied 25 patients with a mean ejection fraction of 38 +/- 9\% scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery. Regional perfusion and metabolism were assessed by positron emission tomography, and regional function was assessed by echocardiography. Perioperative myocardial biopsies were obtained from a control region and from a dysfunctional region. We analyzed biopsies for contents of noncollagen protein (NCP), ATP, ADP, AMP, glycogen and lactate. Six months after surgery we assessed wall motion by echocardiography to group patients in those with (n = 11) and without (n = 14) functional improvement. RESULTS: Reversibly dysfunctional myocardium had reduced perfusion (0.59 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.20 ml/g/min, p < 0.05), similar glucose-tracer uptake (92 +/- 12 and 95 +/- 14\%), ATP/ADP ratio (2.4 +/- 1.1 and 2.4 +/- 0.7), glycogen content (631 +/- 174 and 632 +/- 148 nmol/microg NCP) and lactate levels (59 +/- 27 and 52 +/- 29 nmol/microg NCP) compared with control regions. Irreversibly dysfunctional regions (n = 14) had severely reduced perfusion (0.48 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.72 +/- 0.12 ml/g/min, p < 0.001) and glucose-tracer uptake (52 +/- 16 vs. 94 +/- 15\%, p < 0.001), reduced ATP/ADP ratio (1.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9, p < 0.05), similar glycogen content (579 +/- 265 vs. 593 +/- 127 nmol/microg NCP) and increased lactate levels (114 +/- 52 vs. 89 +/- 24 nmol/microg NCP, p < 0.01) compared with control regions. CONCLUSIONS: Contents of metabolic energy stores and lactate in chronic reversibly dysfunctional myocardium were preserved. In contrast, energy stores were depleted in myocardium without functional recovery after revascularization.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to define the effects of time on contractile function, morphology and functional recovery after coronary revascularization in patients with dysfunctional but viable (hibernating) myocardium. BACKGROUND: Functional recovery after coronary artery bypass graft surgery in patients with chronic myocardial hibernation is incomplete or delayed. The proposed cause is a progressive temporal degeneration of cardiomyocytes. METHODS: In 32 patients with multivessel coronary disease, regional wall motion analysis was performed in hypoperfused but metabolically active areas before and 6 months after bypass surgery. During bypass surgery, transmural biopsy samples were obtained from the center of the hypokinetic zone for light and electron microscopic analyses. The proposed duration of myocardial hibernation was retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: Patients with a subacute hibernating condition (<50 days) demonstrated a higher preoperative ejection fraction (EF, 50+/-8\%), and a better preserved wall motion (WM) in the supraapical wall (-1.4+/-0.4) than did patients with intermediate-term (>50 days, EF 37+/-9\%, p < 0.05; WM -2.4+/-1.5, p = 0.08) or chronic (>6 months, EF 40+/-14\%, WM -2.7+/-0.9, p < 0.005) ischemia. Structural degeneration correlated with the duration of ischemia (r = 0.56, p < 0.05). Postoperative recovery of function was enhanced in patients with a short history of hibernation compared with patients with an intermediate-term or chronic condition (EF 60+/-10\% vs. 40+/-10\%, p < 0.001, and vs. 47+/-14\%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hibernating myocardium exhibits time-dependent deterioration due to progressive structural degeneration with enhanced fibrosis. Early revascularization should be attempted to salvage the jeopardized tissue and improve postoperative outcome.},

	Abstract = {Because aerobic metabolic rates decrease in hypoxia-sensitive cells under oxygen-limiting conditions, the demand for glucose or glycogen for anaerobic glycolysis may rise drastically as a means of making up for the energetic shortfall. However, ion and electrical potentials typically cannot be sustained because of energy insufficiency and high membrane permeabilities; therefore metabolic and membrane functions in effect become decoupled. In hypoxia-tolerant animals, these problems are resolved through a number of biochemical and physiological mechanisms; of these metabolic arrest and stabilized membrane functions are the most effective strategies for extending tolerance to hypoxia. Metabolic arrest is achieved by means of a reversed or negative Pasteur effect (reduced or unchanging glycolytic flux at reduced O2 availability); and coupling of metabolic and membrane function is achievable, in spite of the lower energy turnover rates, by maintaining membranes of low permeability (probably via reduced densities of ion-specific channels). The possibility of combining metabolic arrest with channel arrest has been recognized as an intervention strategy. To date, the success of this strategy has been minimal, mainly because depression of metabolism through cold is the usual arrest mechanism used, and hypothermia in itself perturbs controlled cell function in most endotherms.},

	Abstract = {The molecular origin of standard metabolic rate and thermogenesis in mammals is examined. It is pointed out that there are important differences and distinctions between the cellular reactions that 1) couple to oxygen consumption, 2) uncouple metabolism, 3) hydrolyze ATP, 4) control metabolic rate, 5) regulate metabolic rate, 6) produce heat, and 7) dissipate free energy. The quantitative contribution of different cellular reactions to these processes is assessed in mammals. We estimate that approximately 90\% of mammalian oxygen consumption in the standard state is mitochondrial, of which approximately 20\% is uncoupled by the mitochondrial proton leak and 80\% is coupled to ATP synthesis. The consequences of the significant contribution of proton leak to standard metabolic rate for tissue P-to-O ratio, heat production, and free energy dissipation by oxidative phosphorylation and the estimated contribution of ATP-consuming processes to tissue oxygen consumption rate are discussed. Of the 80\% of oxygen consumption coupled to ATP synthesis, approximately 25-30\% is used by protein synthesis, 19-28\% by the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, 4-8\% by the Ca2(+)-ATPase, 2-8\% by the actinomyosin ATPase, 7-10\% by gluconeogenesis, and 3\% by ureagenesis, with mRNA synthesis and substrate cycling also making significant contributions. The main cellular reactions that uncouple standard energy metabolism are the Na+, K+, H+, and Ca2+ channels and leaks of cell membranes and protein breakdown. Cellular metabolic rate is controlled by a number of processes including metabolic demand and substrate supply. The differences in standard metabolic rate between animals of different body mass and phylogeny appear to be due to proportionate changes in the whole of energy metabolism. Heat is produced by some reactions and taken up by others but is mainly produced by the reactions of mitochondrial respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, and proton leak on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Free energy is dissipated by all cellular reactions, but the major contributions are by the ATP-utilizing reactions and the uncoupling reactions. The functions and evolutionary significance of standard metabolic rate are discussed.},

	Abstract = {NAD(P)H fluorescence, mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration rate were measured and manipulated in isolated liver cells from fed and starved rats in order to characterize control of mitochondrial respiration and phosphorylation. Increased mitochondrial NADH supply stimulated respiration and this accounted for most of the stimulation of respiration by vasopressin and extracellular ATP. From the response of respiration to NADH it was estimated that the control coefficient over respiration of the processes that supply mitochondrial NADH was about 0.15-0.3 in cells from fed rats. Inhibition of the ATP synthase with oligomycin increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased respiration in cells from fed rats, while the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone had the opposite effect. There was a unique relationship between respiration and membrane potential irrespective of the ATP content of the cells indicating that phosphorylation potential controls respiration solely via phosphorylation (rather than by controlling NADH supply). From the response of respiration to the mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi M) it was estimated that the control coefficients over respiration rate in cells from fed rats were: 0.29 by the processes that generate delta psi M, 0.49 by the process of ATP synthesis, transport and consumption, and 0.22 by the processes that cycle protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane other than via ATP synthesis (e.g. the passive proton leak). Control coefficients over the rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis were 0.23, 0.84 and -0.07, respectively, by the same processes. The control distribution in cells from starved rats was similar.},

@article{Brown:1992uq,
	Abstract = {We have seen that there is no simple answer to the question 'what controls respiration?' The answer varies with (a) the size of the system examined (mitochondria, cell or organ), (b) the conditions (rate of ATP use, level of hormonal stimulation), and (c) the particular organ examined. Of the various theories of control of respiration outlined in the introduction the ideas of Chance \& Williams (1955, 1956) give the basic mechanism of how respiration is regulated. Increased ATP usage can cause increased respiration and ATP synthesis by mass action in all the main tissues. Superimposed on this basic mechanism is calcium control of matrix dehydrogenases (at least in heart and liver), and possibly also of the respiratory chain (at least in liver) and ATP synthase (at least in heart). In many tissues calcium also stimulates ATP usage directly; thus calcium may stimulate energy metabolism at (at least) four possible sites, the importance of each regulation varying with tissue. Regulation of multiple sites may occur (from a teleological point of view) because: (a) energy metabolism is branched and thus proportionate regulation of branches is required in order to maintain constant fluxes to branches (e.g. to proton leak or different ATP uses); and/or (b) control over fluxes is shared by a number of reactions, so that large increases in flux requires stimulation at multiple sites because each site has relatively little control. Control may be distributed throughout energy metabolism, possibly due to the necessity of minimizing cell protein levels (see Brown, 1991). The idea that energy metabolism is regulated by energy charge (as proposed by Atkinson, 1968, 1977) is misleading in mammals. Neither mitochondrial ATP synthesis nor cellular ATP usage is a unique function of energy charge as AMP is not a significant regulator (see for example Erecinska et al., 1977). The near-equilibrium hypothesis of Klingenberg (1961) and Erecinska \& Wilson (1982) is partially correct in that oxidative phosphorylation is often close to equilibrium (apart from cytochrome oxidase) and as a consequence respiration and ATP synthesis are mainly regulated by (a) the phosphorylation potential, and (b) the NADH/NAD+ ratio. However, oxidative phosphorylation is not always close to equilibrium, at least in isolated mitochondria, and relative proximity to equilibrium does not prevent the respiratory chain, the proton leak, the ATP synthase and ANC having significant control over the fluxes. Thus in some conditions respiration rate correlates better with [ADP] than with phosphorylation potential, and may be relatively insensitive to mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The metabolic response of cardiomyocytes to moderate and severe hypoxia was assessed by measuring rates of energy consumption and energetic status of cells maintained under these conditions. We found that the rates of energy production were decreased during both forms of hypoxia. Decreased rates of energy production under moderate hypoxia were associated with reduced energy wastage through a downregulation of proton leak in the mitochondria. Cellular protein synthesis and RNA synthesis, major energy-consuming pathways, were downregulated only during severe hypoxia, when oxygen concentrations were low enough to induce energetic stress (quantitatively defined as being any situation in which phosphocreatine concentrations had fallen by > or = 40\%). Our results suggest that energetic stress is the signal responsible for this downregulation.},

	Abstract = {The cell is capable of maintaining a steady-state flux of energy from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, producing ATP, to the cytosolic adenosinetriphosphatases (ATPases), performing work. Considerable effort has been devoted to investigating the individual mechanisms involved in these two processes. However, less effort has been directed toward learning how these reactions of energy metabolism interact through the cytosol to maintain the observed steady state in the intact cell. The "classical" model for the cytosolic interaction of these two processes involves the feedback of ATP hydrolysis products, ADP and Pi, from the ATPases to oxidative phosphorylation. This model is based on data from isolated mitochondria in which the rate of oxidative phosphorylation is controlled by the concentration of ADP and Pi. Yet, recent data from intact tissues with high oxidative phosphorylation capacities (i.e., heart, brain, and kidney) indicate that the cytosolic concentration of ADP and Pi do not change significantly with work. These data imply that this simple feedback model is not adequate to explain the regulation of energy metabolism in these tissues. Other sites within the oxidative phosphorylation process must be playing a regulatory role or the kinetics of ATP synthesis must be very different than currently believed to establish the steady state. This review covers the potential sites within oxidative phosphorylation which may be regulated through cytosolic transducers to result in the necessary feedback network regulating the steady-state flow of energy in the cell. These sites will include substrate delivery to the cytochrome chain, the processes involved in the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, and the delivery of oxygen.},

Low intracellular oxygen levels under normoxia, however, imply mild oxygen limitation, provide protection from oxidative stress, and result from economical strategies for oxygen transport through the respiratory cascade to cytochrome c oxidase. Both perspectives relate to the critical oxygen pressure, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration. Based on methodological considerations of oxygen kinetics and a presentation of high-resolution respirometry, mitochondrial oxygen affinities (1/P(50)) are reviewed with particular emphasis on the turnover effect under control of adenosine diphosphate ADP concentration, which increases the P(50) in active states. ADP/O(2) flux ratios are high even under severe oxygen limitation, as demonstrated by calorespirometry. Oxygen limitation reduces the uncoupled respiration observed under control by ADP, as shown by relationships derived between ADP/O(2) flux ratios, respiratory control ratios, and ADP kinetics. Bioenergetics at low oxygen versus oxidative stress must be considered in the context of limitation of maximum aerobic activity, ischemia-reperfusion injury, mitochondrial signalling to apoptosis, and mitochondrial theories of ageing.},

	Abstract = {Since a constant supply of oxygen is essential to sustain life, organisms have evolved multiple defence mechanisms to ensure maintenance of the delicate balance between oxygen supply and demand. However, this homeostatic balance is perturbed in response to a severe impairment of oxygen supply, thereby activating maladaptive signalling cascades that result in cardiac damage. Past research efforts have largely focused on determining the pathophysiological effects of severe lack of oxygen. By contrast, and as reviewed here, exposure to moderate chronic hypoxia may induce cardioprotective properties. The hypothesis put forward is that chronic hypoxia triggers regulatory pathways that mediate long-term cardiac metabolic remodelling, particularly at the transcriptional level. The novel proposal is that exposure to chronic hypoxia triggers (a) oxygen-sensitive transcriptional modulators that induce a switch to increased carbohydrate metabolism (fetal gene programme) and (b) enhanced mitochondrial respiratory capacity to sustain and increase efficiency of mitochondrial energy production. These compensatory protective mechanisms preserve contractile function despite hypoxia.},

This study sought to determine whether mitochondria function as cellular O2 sensors mediating this response. Embryonic cardiomyocytes were studied under controlled O2 conditions. Hypoxia produced no acute decrease in mitochondrial potential as assessed using tetramethylrhodamine ethylester (TMRE). Cellular [ATP] was preserved throughout hypoxia, as assessed using the probe Magnesium Green. Thus, ATP synthesis and utilization remained closely coupled. Cells adapted to hypoxia for >2 h exhibited a 4\% increase in mitochondrial potential upon reoxygenation, suggesting that a partial inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase had existed. To test whether the oxidase serves as an O2 sensor, azide was administered (1 mM) to simulate the effects of hypoxia by lowering the Vmax of the oxidase. The effects of azide on contraction and mitochondrial potential mimicked the response to hypoxia. We conclude that partial inhibition of cytochrome oxidase during hypoxia allows mitochondria to function as the O2 sensor mediating the decreases in ATP utilization and O2 consumption during hypoxia.},

	Abstract = {Within a few seconds after a sudden reduction of coronary blood flow regional contractile dysfunction ensues. The mechanisms responsible for the rapid reduction in contractile function during acute myocardial ischemia remain unclear, but may involve a rise in inorganic phosphate. When severe ischemia, such as resulting from a sudden and complete coronary artery occlusion, is prolonged for more than 20-40 min, myocardial infarction develops, and there is irreversible loss of contractile function. When myocardial ischemia is less severe but nevertheless prolonged, the myocardium is dysfunctional but can remain viable. In such ischemic and dysfunctional myocardium, contractile function is reduced in proportion to the reduction in regional myocardial blood flow; i.e. a state of "perfusion-contraction matching" exists. The metabolic status of such myocardium improves over the first few hours, as myocardial lactate production is attenuated and creatine phosphate, after an initial reduction, returns towards control values. Ischemic myocardium, characterized by perfusion-contraction matching, metabolic recovery and lack of necrosis, has been termed "short-term hibernating myocardium". Short-term hibernating myocardium can respond to an inotropic stimulation with increased contractile function, however, at the expense of a renewed worsening of the metabolic status. This situation of an increased regional contractile function at the expense of metabolic recovery during inotropic stimulation can be used to identify short-term hibernating myocardium. When inotropic stimulation is prolonged, the development of short-term hibernation is impaired and myocardial infarction develops. The mechanisms responsible for the development of short-term myocardial hibernation remain unclear at present; a significant involvement of adenosine and of activation of ATP-dependent potassium channels has been excluded. Whereas short-term hibernation is well characterized in animal experiments, the existence of hibernation over weeks or months (long-term hibernation) can only be inferred from clinical studies. Hibernation, as defined by Rahimtoola, is a state of chronic contractile dysfunction which is fully reversible upon reperfusion. Clinical syndromes consistent with the existence of myocardial hibernation include unstable and stable angina, acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction and/or congestive heart failure. In long-term hibernating myocardium morphological alterations occur; the myofibrils are reduced in number and disorganized and myocardial glycogen content as well as the extracellular collagen network are increased. Thus, despite the fact that the myocardium remains viable during persistent ischemia and contractile dysfunction is reversible upon reperfusion, there are severe morphological alterations. Understandably, full functional recovery following reperfusion might therefore require weeks or even months.},

	Abstract = {The rates of different ATP-consuming reactions were measured in concanavalin A-stimulated thymocytes, a model system in which more than 80\% of the ATP consumption can be accounted for. There was a clear hierarchy of the responses of different energy-consuming reactions to changes in energy supply: pathways of macromolecule biosynthesis (protein synthesis and RNA/DNA synthesis) were most sensitive to energy supply, followed by sodium cycling and then calcium cycling across the plasma membrane. Mitochondrial proton leak was the least sensitive to energy supply. Control analysis was used to quantify the relative control over ATP production exerted by the individual groups of ATP-consuming reactions. Control was widely shared; no block of reactions had more than one-third of the control. A fuller control analysis showed that there appeared to be a hierarchy of control over the flux through ATP: protein synthesis > RNA/DNA synthesis and substrate oxidation > Na+ cycling and Ca2+ cycling > other ATP consumers and mitochondrial proton leak. Control analysis also indicated that there was significant control over the rates of individual ATP consumers by energy supply. Each ATP consumer had strong control over its own rate but very little control over the rates of the other ATP consumers.},

	Abstract = {We develop a unifying theory of hypoxia tolerance based on information from two cell level models (brain cortical cells and isolated hepatocytes) from the highly anoxia tolerant aquatic turtle and from other more hypoxia sensitive systems. We propose that the response of hypoxia tolerant systems to oxygen lack occurs in two phases (defense and rescue). The first lines of defense against hypoxia include a balanced suppression of ATP-demand and ATP-supply pathways; this regulation stabilizes (adenylates) at new steady-state levels even while ATP turnover rates greatly decline. The ATP demands of ion pumping are down-regulated by generalized "channel" arrest in hepatocytes and by "spike" arrest in neurons. Hypoxic ATP demands of protein synthesis are down-regulated probably by translational arrest. In hypoxia sensitive cells this translational arrest seems irreversible, but hypoxia-tolerant systems activate "rescue" mechanisms if the period of oxygen lack is extended by preferentially regulating the expression of several proteins. In these cells, a cascade of processes underpinning hypoxia rescue and defense begins with an oxygen sensor (a heme protein) and a signal-transduction pathway, which leads to significant gene-based metabolic reprogramming-the rescue process-with maintained down-regulation of energy-demand and energy-supply pathways in metabolism throughout the hypoxic period. This recent work begins to clarify how normoxic maintenance ATP turnover rates can be drastically (10-fold) down-regulated to a new hypometabolic steady state, which is prerequisite for surviving prolonged hypoxia or anoxia. The implications of these developments are extensive in biology and medicine.},

	Abstract = {In cases of severe O(2) limitation, most excitable cells of mammals cannot continue to meet the energy demands of active ion transporting systems, leading to catastrophic membrane failure and cell death. However, in certain lower vertebrates, hypoxia-induced membrane destabilisation of the kind seen in mammals is either slow to develop or does not occur at all owing to adaptive decreases in membrane permeability (i.e. ion 'channel arrest'), that dramatically reduce the energetic costs of ion-balancing ATPases. Mammalian cells do, however, exhibit a whole host of adaptive responses to less severe shortages of oxygen, which include energy-balanced metabolic suppression, ionic-induced activation of O(2) receptors and the upregulation of certain genes, all of which enhance the systemic delivery of oxygen and promote energy conservation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the mechanisms underlying these protective effects are orchestrated into action by putative members of an O(2)-sensing pathway that most if not all cells share in common. In this review we address three major questions: (i) how do cells detect shortages of oxygen and subsequently set in motion adaptive mechanisms of either energy production or energy conservation; (ii) how do these mechanisms restructure cellular pathways of ATP supply and demand to ensure that ion-motive ATPases are given priority over other cell functions to preserve membrane integrity in energy-limited states; and (iii) what mechanisms of molecular and metabolic defence against acute and long-term shortages of oxygen set hypoxia-tolerant systems apart from their hypoxia-sensitive counterparts?},

	Abstract = {Ferret right ventricular hypertrophy is characterized by a decreased and prolonged isometric contraction, associated with altered intracellular calcium (Ca2+) regulation. However myofibrillar composition, cross-bridge function and/or energy transfer may also be involved in these contractile disturbances. Therefore, mechanical properties of myofibrils have been studied with Triton X-100-skinned fibres and troponin (Tn) T and I composition has been examined. Mitochondrial function and functional activity of creatine kinase (CK) isoforms have been studied in saponin-skinned fibres of control (C) and hypertrophied (H) ferret right ventricle, to check for a possible mismatch between energy production and utilization. Our results show that neither TnT nor TnI isoform expression, nor myofibrillar Ca2+ responsiveness (similar apparent Ca2+ sensitivity and Hill coefficient) were affected by pressure-overload. Similarly, maximal tension and stiffness, as well as cross-bridge cycling rate (v)--assessed by quick length changes--were not significantly altered. Importantly, passive stiffness was dramatically increased (163 +/- 30 mN/mm2/microns for C v 500 +/- 121 mN/mm2/microns for H; P < 0.02). Moreover, there was a significant correlation between passive stiffness and cross-bridge cycling rate, indicating that a factor involved in the passive stiffness may affect cross-bridge kinetics. Oxidative capacity (normalized to ventricular dry weight), reflecting mitochondrial ATP production and mitochondrial CK efficacy, as well as myofibrillar CK efficacy (assessed by the shift of MgATP-rigor tension curves before and after phosphocreatine addition), were similar in both groups. These results demonstrate that ferret right ventricular pressure-overload was accompanied by a development of myofibrils and a parallel increase of energy production capacity, transfer and utilization. Decreased compliance, probably linked to an increase in the collagen fraction and/or alterations of the cytoskeletal architecture of the overloaded ventricle, could contribute to the slower time course and decreased amplitude of the isometric twitch.},

@article{Nouette-Gaulain:2005zr,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to characterize mitochondrial adaptation to chronic hypoxia (CH) in the rat heart. Mitochondrial energy metabolism was differentially examined in both left and right ventricles since CH selectively triggers pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. METHODS: Rats were exposed to a hypobaric environment for 2 or 3 weeks and compared with rats maintained in a normoxic environment. Oxidative capacity (oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis) was measured in saponin-skinned fibers with glutamate or palmitoyl carnitine as substrates. Enzymatic activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes were measured on tissue homogenates. Morphometric analysis of mitochondria was performed on electron micrographs. Mitochondrial DNA was quantified using Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: Whereas oxidative capacity of both ventricles was decreased following 21 days of CH, oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis was maintained with the glutamate substrate in the right ventricle following 14 days of CH. As for the oxidative capacity, enzyme activities were decreased only in the left ventricle following 14 days of CH and in both ventricles following 21 days of CH. These functional alterations were associated with an increase in numerical density and a decrease in size of mitochondria without a change in volume density in both ventricles. Finally, 21 days of CH also decreased the ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA in both ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: CH alters morphometry and function of mitochondria in the heart, but this effect is delayed in the right compared to the left ventricle, suggesting some adaptive processes at the onset of right ventricular hypertrophy.},

	Abstract = {This study questioned the effect of living and training at moderate altitude on cardiac morphological and functional adaptations and tested the incidences of potential specific adaptations compared with aerobic sea level training on maximal left ventricular performance. Sea level-native rats were randomly assigned to N (living in normoxia), NT (living and training 5 days/wk for 5 wk in normoxia), CH (living in hypoxia, 2,800 m), and CHT (living and training 5 days/wk for 5 wk in hypoxia, 2,800 m) groups. Cardiac adaptations were evaluated throughout the study period by Doppler echocardiography. Maximal stroke volume (LV(SVmax)) was measured during volume overloading before and after the study period. Finally, at the end of the study period, passive pressure-volume relationships on isolated heart and cardiac weighing were obtained. Altitude training resulted in a specific left ventricular (LV) remodeling compared with NT, characterized by an increase in wall thicknesses without any alteration in internal dimensions. These morphological adaptations associated with hypoxia-induced alterations in pulmonary outflow and preload conditions led to a decrease in LV filling and subsequently no improvement in LV performance during resting physiological conditions in CHT compared with NT. Such a lack of improvement was confirmed during volume overloading that simulated maximal effort (LV(SVmax) pretest: NT = 0.58 +/- 0.05, CHT = 0.57 +/- 0.08 ml; posttest: NT = 0.72 +/- 0.06, CHT = 0.58 +/- 0.07 ml; NT vs. CHT in posttest session, P < 0.05). Maximal aerobic velocities increased to the same extent in NT and CHT rats despite marked polycythemia in the latter. The lack of LV(SVmax) improvement resulting from altitude training-induced cardiac morphological and functional adaptations could be responsible for this phenomenon.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) on cardiac function using MRI. METHODS: In 12 patients (9 women; age range, 30 to 56 years), the diagnosis of PPH had been established by catheterization (mean +/- SD pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] was 56 +/- 8 mm Hg). With breath-hold cine MRI, a series of short-axis images was acquired covering the whole left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). The curvature, defined as 1 divided by the radius of curvature in centimeters, was calculated for the septum and the LV free wall in early diastole. Leftward ventricular septal bowing (LVSB) is denoted by a negative curvature. For the LV and the RV, the end-diastolic volume (EDV), stroke volume (SV), and volumetric filling rate were calculated. The control subjects were all healthy (n = 14; 11 women; age range, 20 to 57 years). RESULTS: In the patients, LVSB was quantified in early diastole by the septal curvature of - 0.14 +/- 0.07 cm(-1), and the septal to free-wall curvature ratio of - 0.42 +/- 0.21. LV EDV and LV SV correlated negatively with diastolic PAP (p = 0.004 and p = 0.04, respectively). In patients vs control subjects, RV SV was reduced (52 +/- 12 mL vs 82 +/- 11 mL, p < 0.0001); LV peak filling rate was smaller (2.2 +/- 0.7 EDV/s vs 3.3 +/- 0.5 EDV/s, p < 0.001); LV EDV was smaller (81 +/- 23 mL vs 117 +/- 19 mL, p = 0.001); and LV SV was smaller (49 +/- 18 mL vs 83 +/- 13 mL, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In PPH, RV pressure overload leads to LVSB and reduced RV output. By decreased blood delivery, LV filling is reduced, which results in decreased LV SV by the Frank-Starling mechanism.},

	Abstract = {In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, competition between the right and left ventricles for the limited pericardial space results in distortion of left ventricular geometry reflected in displacement of the ventricular septum toward the left ventricular cavity. Left ventricular shape is most dramatically deranged at end-systole and early diastole, suggesting the possibility that the distribution of left ventricular diastolic filling might be altered. To investigate this hypothesis, nine patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and nine normal individuals were studied with echocardiographic techniques. Left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time was significantly prolonged in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension by comparison with normal individuals (129 +/- 36 versus 53 +/- 9 ms, p less than 0.005) and the fraction of the transmitral flow velocity integral occurring in the first half of diastole was significantly less than in normal individuals (38 +/- 14\% versus 70 +/- 9\%, p less than 0.005). Measurement of fractional changes in short-axis left ventricular cavity area similarly demonstrated that in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension fractional early diastolic cavity expansion (32 +/- 11\%) was significantly less than in normal individuals (78 +/- 9\%, p less than 0.005). In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the ventricular septum was abnormally flattened toward the left ventricular cavity at end-systole (normalized septal curvature 0.04 +/- 0.19) and remained that way throughout early diastolic filling but returned toward normal at end-diastole (normalized septal curvature 0.68 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The current study examined the effects of bosentan, an orally active antagonist of endothelin-A and -B receptors, on the development and maintenance of hypoxia (10\% O2)-induced pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling in the rat. Pretreatment with bosentan (100 mg.kg-1.day-1, 1 gavage/day for 2 days) completely blocked the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to acute hypoxia. Chronic bosentan treatment (100 mg.kg-1.day-1 po in the food) instituted 48 h before hypoxic exposure prevented the subsequent development of pulmonary hypertension, attenuated the associated right heart hypertrophy, and prevented the remodeling of small (50-100 microns) pulmonary arteries without altering systemic arterial pressure. Institution of bosentan treatment (for 4 wk) after 2 wk of hypoxia produced a significant reversal of established hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (from 36 +/- 1 to 25 +/- 1 mmHg), right heart hypertrophy, and pulmonary vascular remodeling despite continuing hypoxic exposure. These findings support the hypothesis that endogenous endothelin-1 plays a major role in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and/or hypertension, right heart hypertrophy, and pulmonary vascular remodeling and suggest that endothelin-receptor blockade may be useful in the treatment of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension humans.},

	Abstract = {Hypoxia causes constriction in small pulmonary arteries and dilatation in systemic arteries. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is an important mechanism by which pulmonary blood flow is controlled in the fetus and by which local lung perfusion is matched to ventilation in the adult. HPV reduces the flow of desaturated blood through underventilated areas of lung. Even though many vasoactive substances have been examined as possible mediators of HPV, these appear more likely to be modulators than mediators. Hypoxic contraction has been demonstrated in single pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells (PVSMC). The ability to sense changes in oxygen tension is observed in PVSMC and type 1 cells of the carotid body. In both cells, hypoxia has been shown to inhibit an outward potassium current, thus causing membrane depolarization and calcium entry through the voltage-dependent calcium channels. In both cells there is evidence to suggest that changes in the redox status of the oxygen-sensitive potassium channel or channels may control current flow, so that the channel is open when oxidized and closed when reduced. The redox status may be determined by the effects of hypoxia on mitochondrial/peroxisomal function or on the activity of an oxidase similar to NAD(P)H oxidase. More studies are needed to precisely define the individual potassium channels responsive to hypoxia and to confirm the gating mechanism. In systemic arteries hypoxia causes an increased current through ATP-dependent potassium channels and vasodilatation, whereas in the pulmonary arteries hypoxia inhibits potassium current and causes vasoconstriction.},

	Abstract = {Several reports have suggested that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) might result in deterioration of pulmonary gas exchange in severe hypoxia. We therefore investigated the effects of HPV on gas exchange in normal and diseased lungs. We incorporated a biphasic HPV stimulus-response curve observed in intact dogs (S. Brimioulle, and R. Lejeune, J.L. Vachi{\`e}ry, M. Delcroix, R. Hallemans, and R. Naeije, J. Appl. Physiol. 77: 476-480, 1994) into a 50-compartment lung model (J.B. West, Respir. Physiol. 7: 88-110, 1969) to control the amount of blood flow directed to each lung compartment according to the local hypoxic stimulus. The resulting model accurately reproduced the blood gas modifications caused by HPV changes in dogs with acute lung injury. In single lung units, HPV had a moderate protective effect on alveolar oxygenation, which was maximal at near-normal alveolar PO2 (75-80 Torr), mixed venous PO2 (35 Torr), and PO2 at which hemoglobin is 50\% saturated (24 Torr). In simulated diseased lungs associated with 40-60 Torr arterial PO2, however, HPV increased arterial PO2 by 15-20 Torr. We conclude that HPV can improve arterial oxygenation substantially in respiratory failure.},

	Abstract = {The internal control of hepatocyte metabolism has been previously analysed using metabolic control analysis. The aim of this paper is to extend this analysis to include the responses of the cells to hormonal stimulus. Hepatocyte metabolism was divided into nine reaction blocks: glycogen breakdown, glucose release, glycolysis, lactate production, NADH oxidation, pyruvate oxidation, proton leak, mitochondrial phosphorylation and ATP consumption, linked by five intermediates: mitochondrial membrane potential, cytoplasmic NADH/NAD and total cellular ATP, glucose 6-phosphate and pyruvate. The kinetic responses of the reaction blocks to the intermediates were determined previously in the absence of added hormones. In this study, the changes in flux and intermediate levels that occurred upon addition of either glucagon or adrenaline were measured. From comparison of the fractional changes in fluxes and intermediate levels with the known kinetics of the system, it was possible to determine the primary sites of action of the hormones. The results show that the majority of processes in the cell are responsive to the hormones. The notable exception to this is the failure of adrenaline to have a direct effect on glycolysis. The activity change of each metabolic block observed in the presence of either hormone was quantified and compared to the indirect effects on each block caused by changes in metabolite levels. The second stage of the analysis was to use the calculated activity changes and the known control pattern of the system to give a semiquantitative analysis of the regulatory pathways employed by the hormones to achieve the changes in fluxes and metabolite levels. This was instructive in analysing, for example, how glucagon caused a decrease in flux through glycolysis and an increase in oxidative phosphorylation without large changes in metabolite levels (homeostasis). Conversely, it could be seen that the failure of adrenaline to maintain a constant glucose 6-phosphate concentration was due to the stimulation of glycogen breakdown and inhibition of glucose release.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews top-down regulation analysis, a part of metabolic control analysis, and shows how it can be used to analyse steady states, regulation and homeostasis in complex systems such as energy metabolism in mitochondria, cells and tissues. A steady state is maintained by the variables in a system; regulation is the way the steady state is changed by external effectors. We can exploit the properties of the steady state to measure the kinetic responses (elasticities) of reactions to the concentrations of intermediates and effectors. We can reduce the complexity of the system under investigation by grouping reactions into large blocks connected by a small number of explicit intermediates-this is the top-down approach to control analysis. Simple titrations then yield all the values of elasticities and control coefficients within the system. We can use these values to quantify the relative strengths of different internal pathways that act to keep an intermediate or a rate constant in the steady state. We can also use them to quantify the relative strengths of different primary actions of an external effector and the different internal pathways that transmit its effects through the system, to describe regulation and homeostasis. This top-down regulation analysis has been used to analyse steady states of energy metabolism in mitochondria, cells and tissues, and to analyse regulation of energy metabolism by cadmium, an external effector, in mitochondria. The combination of relatively simple experiments and new theoretical structures for presenting and interpreting the results means that top-down regulation analysis provides a novel and effective way to analyse steady states, regulation and homeostasis in intricate metabolic systems.},

In this study, we report mathematical relationships that relate the finite changes in system variables (fluxes and metabolite concentrations) to changes in activity of metabolic processes brought about by a single step addition of an effector. The activation or inhibition of a process by an effector is measured from changes in flux and intermediate levels. The changes in activity of each process can be used to describe, semi-quantitatively, which activations or inhibitions of the system processes are important in bringing about the observed levels of system variables.},

Using this technique, it has been shown that butyrate (10 mM) in the perfusion medium decreases the flux through the initial steps of the glycolytic pathway by at least 6-fold and that both glucose phosphorylation and glycogenolysis are inhibited. Upon total global ischemia in the presence of both glucose and butyrate, the glycolysis rate is stimulated approx. 100-fold.},

	Abstract = {The fundamental principle of cardiac behaviour is described by the Frank-Starling law relating force of contraction during systole with end-diastolic volume. While both work and respiration rates increase linearly with imposed load, the basis of mechano-energetic coupling in heart muscle has remained a long-standing enigma. Here, we highlight advances made in understanding of complex cellular and molecular mechanisms that orchestrate coupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with ATP utilization for muscle contraction. Cardiac system bioenergetics critically depends on an interrelated metabolic infrastructure regulating mitochondrial respiration and energy fluxes throughout cellular compartments. The data reviewed indicate the significance of two interrelated systems regulating mitochondrial respiration and energy fluxes in cells: (1) the creatine kinase, adenylate kinase and glycolytic pathways that communicate flux changes generated by cellular ATPases within structurally organized enzymatic modules and networks; and (2) a secondary system based on mitochondrial participation in cellular calcium cycle, which adjusts substrate oxidation and energy-transducing processes to meet increasing cellular energy demands. By conveying energetic signals to metabolic sensors, coupled phosphotransfer reactions provide a high-fidelity regulation of the excitation-contraction cycle. Such integration of energetics with calcium signalling systems provides the basis for 'metabolic pacing', synchronizing the cellular electrical and mechanical activities with energy supply processes.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews top-down elasticity analysis, which is a subset of metabolic control analysis. Top-down elasticity analysis provides a systematic yet simple experimental method to identify all the primary sites of action of an effector in complex systems and to distinguish them from all the secondary, indirect, sites of action. In the top-down approach, the complex system (for example, a mitochondrion, cell, organ or organism) is first conceptually divided into a small number of blocks of reactions interconnected by one or more metabolic intermediates. By changing the concentration of one intermediate when all others are held constant and measuring the fluxes through each block of reactions, the overall kinetic response of each block to each intermediate can be established. The concentrations of intermediates can be changed by adding new branches to the system or by manipulating the activities of blocks of reactions whose kinetics are not under investigation. To determine how much an effector alters the overall kinetics of a block of reactions, the overall kinetic response of the block to the intermediate is remeasured in the presence of the effector. Blocks that contain significant primary sites of action will display altered kinetics; blocks that change rate only because of secondary alterations in the concentrations of other metabolites will not. If desired, this elasticity analysis can be repeated with the primary target blocks subdivided into simpler blocks so that the primary sites of action can be defined with more and more precision until, with sufficient subdivision, they are mapped onto individual kinetic steps. Top-down elasticity analysis has been used to identify the targets of effectors of oxygen consumption in mitochondria, hepatocytes and thymocytes. Effectors include poisons such as cadmium and hormones such as triiodothyronine. However, the method is more general than this; in principle it can be applied to any metabolic or other steady-state system.},

	Abstract = {By using a newly developed optical technique which enables non-invasive measurement of mitochondrial oxygenation (mitoPO(2)) in the intact heart, we addressed three long-standing oxygenation questions in cardiac physiology: 1) what is mitoPO(2) within the in vivo heart?, 2) is mitoPO(2) heterogeneously distributed?, and 3) how does mitoPO(2) of the isolated Langendorff-perfused heart compare with that in the in vivo working heart? Following calibration and validation studies of the optical technique in isolated cardiomyocytes, mitochondria and intact hearts, we show that in the in vivo condition mean mitoPO(2) was 35+/-5 mm Hg. The mitoPO(2) was highly heterogeneous, with the largest fraction (26\%) of mitochondria having a mitoPO(2) between 10 and 20 mm Hg, and 10\% between 0 and 10 mm Hg. Hypoxic ventilation (10\% oxygen) increased the fraction of mitochondria in the 0-10 mm Hg range to 45\%, whereas hyperoxic ventilation (100\% oxygen) had no major effect on mitoPO(2). For Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, mean mitoPO(2) was 29+/-5 mm Hg with the largest fraction of mitochondria (30\%) having a mitoPO(2) between 0 and 10 mm Hg. Only in the maximally vasodilated condition, did the isolated heart compare with the in vivo heart (11\% of mitochondria between 0 and 10 mm Hg). These data indicate 1) that the mean oxygen tension at the level of the mitochondria within the heart in vivo is higher than generally considered, 2) that mitoPO(2) is considerably heterogeneous, and 3) that mitoPO(2) of the classic buffer-perfused Langendorff heart is shifted to lower values as compared to the in vivo heart.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess whether oxygen supply is sufficient to induce normoxic conditions in isolated rat hearts. Hearts are perfused with a Krebs medium supplemented with 11 mM glucose, 0.6 mM lactate, 0.06 mM pyruvate, non delipidated albumin (0.1 mM fatty acids), and either 1.78 mM or 0.76 mM free calcium, at 10 ml.min-1. Graded hypoxia is induced by a stepwise decrease of partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) from 660 to 52 mmHg. Contractile performance, oxygen uptake and lactate plus pyruvate balance are assessed. With high calcium, left ventricular developed pressure, dP/dt max and oxygen uptake increase linearly with PO2 up to 660 mmHg; heart rate increases with PO2 up to 250 mmHg and then tends to stabilize. With low calcium, all parameters reach a plateau over 400 mmHg. Lactate plus pyruvate production suggests a stimulation of glycolysis with high calcium, even at 660 mmHg; conversely, there is no lactate plus pyruvate production with low calcium over 250 mmHg. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that, under a high level of calcium at a constant flow of 10 ml.min-1, cardiac function is always limited by O2 supply, except for heart rate. This raises the question as to the definition of a normoxic state. The better preservation of heart rate during hypoxia, compared to other dynamic parameters, could be explained by a contribution of glycolytic ATP.},

	Abstract = {A new approach to the determination of flux and concentration control coefficients in metabolic pathways is outlined. Linear pathways are conceptually divided in two around an intermediate metabolite (or group or metabolites) and the control coefficients of the two parts are derived from the elasticity coefficients of the two parts to the intermediate. Branched pathways are treated similarly, the control coefficients of the branches being derived either from the elasticities of the branches to their common intermediate or from the relative flux changes of the branches. Repeating this analysis around other intermediates in the pathway allows the control coefficients of smaller and smaller groups of enzymes to be determined. In complex systems this approach to describing control may have several advantages over determining the control coefficients of individual enzymes and is a potentially useful complementary approach.},

Direct effects of ceramide on mitochondria (cytochrome c release, respiratory chain inhibition, oxygen radicals production...) have been reported [1, 2] and we previously showed that addition of ceramide to intact cells or isolated mitochondria triggers mitochondrial swelling which appeared to be insensitive to cyclosporin A (CsA) [3, 4]. The purpose of this work was to determine to which extent this CsA-insensitive mitochondrial swelling, therefore distinct from permeability transition, participates to ceramide-induced apoptosis. To achieve this, we applied Top-Down analysis of integrated mitochondrial function [5], in order to better understand ceramide-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions.},

	Abstract = {We have analyzed the control exerted by the pathways of oxidative phosphorylation, gluconeogenesis, ureagenesis, and maintenance ATP consumption over each other's rates in isolated, perfused rat liver using top-down metabolic control analysis. The livers from fasted rats were perfused with 3-hydroxybutyrate as respiratory substrate, lactate as substrate for gluconeogenesis, and ammonium as substrate for urea synthesis, in conditions where these pathways were only linked by their common intermediates: ATP, ADP, and Pi. The rates of oxygen consumption, glucose and urea synthesis were measured continuously. The pathways were perturbed either by adding specific inhibitors or by adding new pathways that consumed ATP, and the relative changes in pathway rates were used to calculate the flux control coefficients of each pathway over all pathway rates. When the liver was in a relatively inactive metabolic state, where ATP was only being used by the maintenance ATP-consuming pathways, then essentially all the control over ATP production and consumption was located in the maintenance ATP consumers with ATP production having no control. Whereas, when the liver was in a highly active state using extra ATP for both glucose and urea synthesis, then ATP production (from oxidative phosphorylation) had strong control over its own rate and the rates of glucose and urea synthesis, but gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis still had strong control over their own rates and negative control over each others rates, i.e. they competed for the limited ATP supply. The rate of the maintenance ATP consumers is remarkably insensitive to changes in ATP production and consumption, but exerts considerable control over all other pathways. These results indicate that the general assumption that the rates of ATP production and consumption are controlled exclusively by ATP consumers is false under conditions where a significant amount of ATP is used for biosynthetic processes, such as glucose and urea synthesis, and indicate that the latter processes may be partly controlled by regulators of ATP production and by other ATP-consuming pathways.},

	Abstract = {Control over oxidative phosphorylation by purified potato mitochondria was determined using the top-down approach of metabolic control analysis. The control over the respiration rate, phosphorylation rate, proton-leak rate and proton motive force exerted by the respiratory chain, phosphorylation reactions and the proton leak were measured over a range of phosphorylation rates from resting (state 4) to maximal (state 3). These rates were obtained by adding different amounts of hexokinase in the presence of glucose, or different amounts of oligomycin in the presence of ADP. The respiratory substrate was NADH or succinate, both of which feed electrons directly to ubiquinone. The rate of oxygen consumption by the alternative oxidase pathway was negligible with NADH as substrate but was measurable with succinate and was subtracted. Control over the respiration rate in potato mitochondria was predominantly exerted by the respiratory chain at all rates except close to state 4, where control by the proton leak was equally or more important. For oxidation of NADH, the flux control coefficient over the respiration rate exerted by the respiratory chain in state 3 was between 0.8 and 1.0, while in state 4, control over the respiration rate was shared about equally between the chain and the proton leak. The control over the phosphorylation rate was predominantly exerted by the respiratory chain, although at low rates control by the phosphorylation system was also important. For oxidation of NADH, the flux control coefficient over the phosphorylation rate exerted by the respiratory chain in state 3 was 0.8-1.0, while near state 4 the flux control coefficients over the phosphorylation rate were about 0.8 for the phosphorylation system and 0.25 for the chain. Control over the proton leak rate was shared between the respiratory chain and the proton leak; the phosphorylation system had negative control. For oxidation of NADH, the flux control coefficients over the leak rate in state 3 were 1.0 for the leak, 0.4 for the chain and -0.4 for the phosphorylation system, while in state 4 the flux control coefficients over leak rate were about 0.5 for the leak and 0.5 for the chain. Control over the magnitude of the protonmotive force was small, between -0.2 and +0.2, reflecting the way the system operates to keep the protonmotive force fairly constant; the respiratory chain and the phosphorylation system had equal and opposite control and there was very little control by the proton leak except near state 4.},

We measured the relationship between respiration rate and membrane potential as respiration was titrated by the addition of malonate under each condition. We used the flux control summation and connectivity theorems and the branching theorem of metabolic control theory to calculate the control over respiration rate exerted by the respiratory chain (and associated reactions), phosphorylating system (and associated reactions) and proton leak at each respiration rate. The analysis also yielded the flux control coefficients of these three reactions over phosphorylation rate and proton leak rate and their concentration control coefficients over protonmotive force. We found that respiration rate was controlled largely by the proton leak under non-phosphorylating conditions, by the phosphorylating system at intermediate rates and by both the phosphorylating system and the respiratory chain in state 3. The rate of phosphorylation was controlled largely by the phosphorylating system itself in state 4 and at intermediate rates, while state 3 control was shared between the phosphorylating system and the respiratory chain; the proton leak had insignificant control. In all states the phosphorylating system had large negative control over the proton leak; the chain and the proton leak both had large positive control coefficients. The protonmotive force was controlled by the chain and by the phosphorylating system; the proton leak had little control.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypoxic states of the cardiovacular system are undoubtedly associated with the most frequent diseases of modern time. Therefore, understanding hypoxic resistance encountered after physiological adaptation such as chronic hypoxia, is crucial to better deal with hypoxic insult. In this study, we examine the role of energetic modifications induced by chronic hypoxia (CH) in the higher tolerance to oxygen deprivation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Swiss mice were exposed to a simulated altitude of 5500 m in a barochamber for 21 days. Isolated perfused hearts were used to study the effects of a decreased oxygen concentration in the perfusate on contractile performance (RPP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) concentration (assessed by (31)P-NMR), and to describe the integrated changes in cardiac energetics regulation by using Modular Control Analysis (MoCA). Oxygen reduction induced a concomitant decrease in RPP (-46\%) and in [PCr] (-23\%) in Control hearts while CH hearts energetics was unchanged. MoCA demonstrated that this adaptation to hypoxia is the direct consequence of the higher responsiveness (elasticity) of ATP production of CH hearts compared with Controls (-1.88+/-0.38 vs -0.89+/-0.41, p<0.01) measured under low oxygen perfusion. This higher elasticity induces an improved response of energy supply to cellular energy demand. The result is the conservation of a healthy control pattern of contraction in CH hearts, whereas Control hearts are severely controlled by energy supply. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As suggested by the present study, the mechanisms responsible for this increase in elasticity and the consequent improved ability of CH heart metabolism to respond to oxygen deprivation could participate to limit the damages induced by hypoxia.},

	Abstract = {The intracellular mechanisms of regulation of energy fluxes and respiration in contracting heart cells were studied. For this, we investigated the workload dependencies of the rate of oxygen consumption and metabolic parameters in Langendorff-perfused isolated rat hearts.(31)P NMR spectroscopy was used to study the metabolic changes during transition from perfusion with glucose to that with pyruvate with and without active creatine kinase system. The experimental results showed that transition from perfusion with glucose to that with pyruvate increased the phosphocreatine content and stability of its level at increased workloads. Inhibition of creatine kinase reaction by 15-min infusion of iodoacetamide decreased the maximal developed tension and respiration rates by a factor of two.(31)P NMR data were analyzed by a mathematical model of compartmentalized energy transfer, which is independent from the restrictions of the classical concept of creatine kinase equilibrium. The analysis of experimental data by this model shows that metabolic stability-constant levels of phosphocreatine, ATP and inorganic phosphate-at increased energy fluxes is an inherent property of the compartmentalized system. This explains the observed substrate specificity by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. The decreased maximal respiration rate and maximal work output of the heart with inhibited creatine kinase is well explained by the rise in myoplasmic ADP concentration. This activates the adenylate kinase reaction in the myofibrillar space and in the mitochondria to fulfil the energy transfer and signal transmission functions, usually performed by creatine kinase. The activity of this system, however, is not sufficient to maintain high enough energy fluxes. Therefore, there is a kinetic explanation for the decreased maximal respiration rate of the heart with inhibited creatine kinase: i.e. a kinetically induced switch from an efficient energy transfer pathway (PCr-CK system) to a non-efficient one (myokinase pathway) within the energy transfer network of the cell under conditions of low apparent affinity of mitochondria to ADP in vivo. This may result in a significant decrease in the thermodynamic affinity of compartmentalized ATPase systems and finally in heart failure.},

	Abstract = {Heart contraction is characterized by the absence of changes in energetic intermediates in response to a large increase of activity. Until now no experimental approach could address this question concerning the intact beating heart. Ca(2+) plays a crucial role in the excitation-contraction coupling, and in vitro studies have evidenced that Ca(2+) may also directly activate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We applied our new in situ modular control and regulation analysis on isolated beating rat heart perfused under two different calcium concentrations with pyruvate or glucose as the substrate. Modular control analysis demonstrated experimentally that, although control by energy production was slightly higher under glucose conditions compared with pyruvate, most of the control of heart contraction resides in energy utilization. This behavior is the direct consequence of the high sensitivity (elasticity) of the energy producer processes to ATP utilization. Interestingly, the increase in heart metabolic rate by Ca(2+) did not significantly change the pattern of control distribution. The regulation analysis performed under the two calcium conditions demonstrated a balanced activation of myofibrils ATPases, and mitochondrial ATP synthesis in response to Ca(2+) increase. This first study demonstrates in situ the hypothesis that the energetic adequation in heart contraction is mediated by a parallel activation of both processes of energy production and utilization by Ca(2+). The results presented here show that modular control and regulation analyses allow in situ study of internal regulations in intact beating heart energetics and function and may now be applied to heart dysfunctions and therapeutic effects.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been used for several decades to examine the biochemistry of the myocardium in a non destructive manner. (31)P MRS, in particular, has been used to study heart failure. (31)P MRS allows for the detection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy source for all energy consuming processes in cardiomyocytes, and phosphocreatine (PCr). Via the creatine kinase (CK) reaction PCr forms the primary ATP buffer in the cell and is involved in transporting the chemical energy from the ATP-producing mitochondria to the ATP-consuming contractile proteins. MRS examination of the failing heart has revealed that PCr, and to a lesser extent, ATP is reduced. These findings have led to the concept that the heart is energy starved. The additional application of (1)H MRS has allowed for the detection of total creatine, allowing for in depth examination of the creatine kinase system. Using saturation transfer techniques it is also possible to measure flux through the CK reaction in the intact heart, and the application of this technique has proven that in the failing human heart this flux is reduced. In recent years the study of transgenic animal models by MRS has led to further insights into the role of energy metabolism in heart failure.},

Most applications of cardiac MRS have been performed with the 31P nuclei, which reflect the metabolites from the high-energy phosphate metabolism. Other nuclei, such as 1H or 13C, have also been investigated but less intensively, most likely because of either large background signals (e.g., water) or inherent low sensitivity of the method.

	Abstract = {The high energy demands of the heart are met primarily by the metabolism of fatty acids and carbohydrates. These energy substrates are efficiently and rapidly metabolized in order to produce the high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) necessary to sustain both contractile activity and other cellular functions. Alterations in energy metabolism contribute to abnormal heart function in many cardiac diseases. As a result, a number of techniques have been developed to directly measure energy metabolism in the heart in order to study energy metabolism. Two important variables that must be considered when making these measurements are energy substrate supply to the heart and the metabolic demand of the heart (i.e. contractile function). The use of the in vitro/ex vivo heart, perfused with relevant energy substrates, is a useful experimental approach that accounts for these variables. This paper overviews a number of the techniques that are used to measure energy substrate metabolism in the isolated perfused heart. Recently developed technology that allows for the direct measurement of energy metabolism in an isolated working mouse heart preparation are also described.},

	Abstract = {During the past six or seven years, high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been established as a powerful tool for the study of cellular metabolism in isolated cells and organs. The non-invasive nature of the measurement offers many advantages over conventional analytical techniques, but limitations on sensitivity restrict the method to the observation of molecules present in the cell at relatively high concentrations (in the order of 0.5-1 mM). Inevitably, many of the initial investigations tended to confirm existing knowledge, but this was important in establishing the validity of the NMR method. In the last few years, NMR has contributed new and interesting information on several aspects of metabolism and metabolic regulation. The majority of reports deal with 31P, 13C, and, to a lesser extent, 1H NMR. The particular areas of interest include measurements of metabolic fluxes in the steady state and transport processes, observations of cellular pH and H+ ion distribution, and compartmentation and spatially resolved NMR of whole animals. The ability to directly observe the intracellular milieu is perhaps the major single advantage of NMR. A very large number of different systems can be studied, but it is important to keep in mind that NMR is simply an additional method for studying metabolism and must always be combined with carefully designed biochemical experiments.},

Each group (control, hypoxic, pair-fed, n = 16), was divided into two sub-groups housed individually in either normal cages or cages with running wheels allowing evaluation of voluntary activity (n = 8 each). The skinned-fibre technique was used to evaluate the functional properties of myofibrillar mitochondria from right and left ventricles in situ. The oxidative fibres from the soleus and diaphragm muscles were also investigated for comparison. Analysis of variance did not detect any significant effect of voluntary running activity. With calorie restriction, the maximal respiratory rate (Vmax) in the presence of 1 mM adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) in myocardial fibres fell significantly (by about 25\%) but was unchanged in skeletal myocytes. Following hypoxia, Vmax in myocardial fibres increased by 25\% compared with the calorie restricted group and in soleus and diaphragm muscle fibres by about 30\% compared with control. In myocardial fibres of control rats, creatine (20 mM) increased the sub-maximal respiratory rate by 80\% in the presence of 0.1 mM ADP. Under calorie restriction or hypoxia the stimulatory effect was significantly reduced to 34-56\%. This alteration was due to a decrease in the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of mitochondrial respiration for ADP evaluated in the absence of creatine, while the Km in presence of creatine 20 mM was unchanged. In conclusion, reduced food intake decreased the oxidative capacity (Vmax) and the apparent Km for ADP of mitochondria in both left and right ventricles. Chronic hypoxia per se was responsible for an increase in the oxidative capacity of all oxidative muscles but did not exert significant effects on the control of respiration by ADP and creatine in myocardium.},

Adult female rats were exposed to normobaric hypoxia (FiO2 = 0.10) for three weeks; pair-fed rats, kept under normoxic conditions, received the same amount of food as hypoxic rats. The oxidative capacity of myocardial ventricles and some skeletal muscles was evaluated using permeabilized fibers. Several metabolic enzyme activities were measured on extracts from myocardium and soleus. Diet restriction increased the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in both ventricles while it augmented phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activities only in the left ventricle and depressed the respiratory rate in the right ventricle only. Hypoxia per se induced a rise in hexokinase activity in all studied oxidative muscles and a fall of hydroxy-acyl CoA-dehydrogenase activity in both myocardial ventricles. The respiratory rate and the citrate synthase activities were unaffected by hypoxia. We conclude that chronic hypoxia per se leads to specific alterations in myocardial metabolism that could favor the use of exogenous glucose at the expense of free fatty acids without any change in the oxidative capacity.},

	Abstract = {During low-to-high work transition in adult mammalian heart in vivo the concentrations of free ADP, ATP, PCr (phosphocreatine), P(i) and NADH are essentially constant, in striking contrast with skeletal muscle. The direct activation by calcium ions of ATP usage and feedback activation of ATP production by ADP (and P(i)) alone cannot explain this perfect homoeostasis. A comparison of the response to adrenaline (increase in rate-pressure product and [PCr]) of the intact beating perfused rat heart with the elasticities of the PCr producer and consumer to PCr concentration demonstrated that both the ATP/PCr-producing block and ATP/PCr-consuming block are directly activated to a similar extent during physiological heart activation. Our finding constitutes a direct evidence for the parallel-activation mechanism of the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in heart postulated previously in a theoretical way.},

	Abstract = {Modular control analysis (MoCA; Diolez P, Deschodt-Arsac V, Raffard G, Simon C, Santos PD, Thiaudiere E, Arsac L, Franconi JM. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 293: R13-R19, 2007) was applied here on perfused hearts to describe the modifications of the regulation of heart energetics induced in mice exposed to 3-wk chronic hypoxia. MoCA combines 31P-NMR spectroscopy and modular (top down) control analysis to describe the integrative regulation of energy metabolism in the intact beating heart, on the basis of two modules [ATP/phosphocreatine (PCr) production and ATP/PCr consumption] connected by the energetic intermediates. In contrast with previous results in rat heart, in which all control of contraction was on ATP demand, mouse heart energetics presented a shared control of contraction between ATP/PCr-producing and -consuming modules. In chronic hypoxic mice, the decrease in heart contractile activity and PCr-to-ATP ratio was surprisingly associated with an important and significant higher response of ATP/PCr production (elasticity) to PCr changes compared with control hearts (-10.4 vs. -2.46). By contrast, no changes were observed in ATP/PCr consumption since comparable elasticities were observed. Since elasticities determine the regulation of energetics of heart contraction, the present results show that this new parameter may be used to uncover the origin of the observed dysfunctions under chronic hypoxia conditions. Considering the decrease in mitochondrial content reported after exposure to chronic hypoxia, it appears that the improvement of ATP/PCr production response to ATP demand may be viewed as a positive adaptative mechanism. It now appears crucial to understand the very processes responsible for ATP/PCr producer elasticity toward the energetic intermediates, as well as their regulation.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondrial respiration/oxidative phosphorylation is the main source of energy, in the form of ATP, in the heart under physiological conditions. Different respiratory substrates were used in various experiments during heart perfusion: glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glucose+pyruvate, glucose+lactate, glucose+insulin etc. Also under physiological conditions, the concentration of respiratory substrates/hormones in blood can vary significantly. In the present study, we tested the effect of pyruvate, lactate and insulin (all in the presence of glucose) and glucose (in the presence of pyruvate) on the ATP-producing and -consuming blocks in perfused rat heart, in a system where HR (heart rate) was allowed to vary (no pacing). Changes in RPP (rate-pressure product) and PCr (phosphocreatine) concentration were measured. PAA (Proportional Activation Approach) was used to visualize and quantitatively analyse the data. It was demonstrated that addition of glucose (in the presence of pyruvate) exerted essentially no effect on the system. Insulin (in the presence of glucose) activated only the ATP producer. The most interesting finding is that, in our system, pyruvate and lactate (added in the presence or instead of glucose) activated ATP producer, but significantly inhibited ATP consumer (their effect was quantitatively identical).},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of steady-state True fast imaging with steady precession (TrueFISP) four-dimensional imaging of mouse heart at high resolution and its efficiency for cardiac volumetry. Three-dimensional cine-imaging of control and hypoxic mice was carried out at 4.7 T without magnetization preparation or ECG-triggering. The k-space lines were acquired with the TrueFISP sequence (pulse repetition time/echo time = 4/2 ms) in a repeated sequential manner. Retrospective reordering of raw data allowed the reconstruction of 10 three-dimensional images per cardiac cycle. The acquisition scheme used an alternating radiofrequency phase and sum-of-square reconstruction method. Black-blood three-dimensional images at around 200 mum resolution were produced without banding artifact throughout the cardiac cycle. High contrast to noise made it possible to estimate cavity volumes during diastole and systole. Right and left ventricular stroke volume was significantly higher in hypoxic mice vs controls (20.2 +/- 2 vs 15.1 +/- 2; P < 0.05, 24.9 +/- 2 vs 20.4 +/- 2; P < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, four-dimensional black-blood TrueFISP imaging in living mice is a method of choice to investigate cardiac abnormalities in mouse models. Magn Reson Med, 2009.
